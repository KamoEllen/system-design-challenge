#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Google Spanner and Causal Consistency.
- **Goal**: Understand how Spanner enables efficient distributed reads while maintaining causal consistency.

#### **2. The Problem: Distributed Reads**
- **Definition**: In distributed databases, data is partitioned across multiple nodes, and relationships between data may span partitions.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring **causal consistency** when reading data from multiple partitions.
  - **Causal Consistency**: If a read depends on a previous write, the read must include that write to maintain logical consistency.
  - **Example**:
    - **Partition A**: Contains a comment ("Celtics suck") with ID `A1`.
    - **Partition B**: Contains a reply ("go next") with a parent ID `A1`.
    - Reading from Partition B must also include the parent comment from Partition A to maintain consistency.

#### **3. Traditional Solutions and Their Limitations**
1. **Snapshots**:
   - **Idea**: Use snapshots to ensure consistent reads across partitions.
   - **Problem**: Snapshots are not synchronized across partitions, making it difficult to align them for causal consistency.
   - **Example**:
     - Partition A has transaction 101, while Partition B has transaction 25.
     - No inherent synchronization between transaction numbers across partitions.
2. **Locking**:
   - **Idea**: Use **two-phase locking** to lock rows during reads and writes.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Readers grab **shared locks**.
     - Writers grab **exclusive locks**.
   - **Problem**:
     - Locking is slow and blocks writes, especially for large-scale reads (e.g., analytical queries).
     - Can bring the system to a halt during large reads.

#### **4. How Spanner Solves the Problem**
- **Core Idea**: Use **timestamps** to ensure causal consistency without locking.
  - **Timestamps**: Assign a timestamp to each write with an **uncertainty interval**.
  - **Uncertainty Interval**: A range of time (e.g., 100–102 seconds) within which the write is guaranteed to have occurred.
  - **Commit Rule**: Wait for the uncertainty interval to pass before committing the write.
    - Ensures that the actual timestamp of the write is greater than the upper bound of the interval.
- **Example**:
  - **Write 1**:
    - Uncertainty interval: 100–102 seconds.
    - Wait 2 seconds, then commit at timestamp `T1` (guaranteed > 102).
  - **Write 2** (depends on Write 1):
    - Reads Write 1 at timestamp `T1` or later.
    - Uncertainty interval: `X–Y` seconds (where `Y > T1`).
    - Wait `Y - X` seconds, then commit at timestamp `T2` (guaranteed > `T1`).
  - **Result**: Any causally dependent writes will have strictly increasing timestamps.

#### **5. Spanner's Use of GPS Clocks**
- **Problem**: Timestamps in distributed systems can drift due to clock inaccuracies and network latency.
- **Solution**: Use **GPS clocks** in every data center to synchronize timestamps.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Each data center has a GPS clock to ensure highly accurate timestamps.
    - Reduces the uncertainty interval (`Delta`) to a very small value.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Minimizes the waiting time for writes.
    - Enables fast, causally consistent reads without locking.
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - Expensive to implement (requires GPS clocks in every data center).
    - Spanner is a proprietary system, available only through Google Cloud.

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Spanner**:
  - Uses **timestamps** and **uncertainty intervals** to ensure causal consistency.
  - Avoids locking by waiting for the uncertainty interval to pass before committing writes.
  - Relies on **GPS clocks** to minimize uncertainty and maintain high performance.
- **Causal Consistency**:
  - Ensures that reads include all dependent writes.
  - Critical for maintaining logical consistency in distributed systems.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Spanner is highly efficient but expensive to operate.
  - Best suited for applications requiring strict consistency and high performance.

#### **7. Conclusion**
- **Spanner** provides a unique solution to the problem of distributed reads by leveraging **timestamps**, **uncertainty intervals**, and **GPS clocks**.
- While it avoids the performance bottlenecks of traditional locking mechanisms, it comes with higher operational costs.
- In the next video, we’ll explore other distributed database systems and compare their approaches to Spanner.
