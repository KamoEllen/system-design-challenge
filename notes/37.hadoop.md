#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Hadoop and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
- **Goal**: Understand the architecture, functionality, and use cases of HDFS.

---

#### **2. What is Hadoop?**
- **Definition**: A distributed computing framework designed for **big data storage** and **large-scale computations**.
- **Key Components**:
  1. **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A distributed file storage system.
  2. **MapReduce/Spark**: Frameworks for distributed data processing (covered in future videos).

---

#### **3. HDFS Overview**
- **Definition**: A **distributed file system** designed to store and manage large datasets across multiple machines.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Rack Awareness**: Optimizes data placement to minimize network latency.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Replicates data across nodes to ensure availability.
  - **Scalability**: Handles petabytes of data across thousands of nodes.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Name Node**: Stores metadata about files and their locations.
  - **Data Nodes**: Store the actual data blocks.

---

#### **4. Name Node**
- **Role**: Acts as the **metadata manager** for HDFS.
- **Functions**:
  - Tracks file locations and versions across data nodes.
  - Manages replication (e.g., ensures 3 replicas per file).
  - Optimizes data placement for performance and fault tolerance.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Uses a **write-ahead log (WAL)** to record operations.
  - Can take snapshots of metadata and replay logs for recovery.
- **High Availability**:
  - Uses **Zookeeper** for distributed consensus.
  - A **secondary Name Node** can take over if the primary fails.

---

#### **5. Data Nodes**
- **Role**: Store the actual data blocks.
- **Replication**:
  - Each file is replicated across multiple nodes (e.g., 3 replicas).
  - Ensures fault tolerance and high availability.
- **Communication**:
  - Data Nodes periodically report their status and stored files to the Name Node.

---

#### **6. Reading Files in HDFS**
1. **Client Request**: The client asks the Name Node for the file location.
2. **Name Node Response**: Returns the closest replica to minimize latency.
3. **Client Cache**: The client caches the file location for future reads.
4. **Data Retrieval**: The client reads the file directly from the closest Data Node.

---

#### **7. Writing Files in HDFS**
1. **Client Request**: The client asks the Name Node for replica locations.
2. **Replica Selection**: The Name Node selects a **primary replica** (closest to the client) and secondary replicas.
3. **Replication Pipeline**:
   - The client writes to the primary replica.
   - The primary replica forwards the data to the secondary replicas in a pipeline.
4. **Acknowledgment**: The client receives an acknowledgment once all replicas have written the data.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - If a replica fails, the client may retry or accept eventual consistency.
  - HDFS is **not strongly consistent** in case of failures.

---

#### **8. High Availability in HDFS**
- **Problem**: A single Name Node is a **single point of failure**.
- **Solution**: Use **Zookeeper** for distributed consensus and **State Machine Replication**.
  - **Zookeeper**: Maintains a distributed log of Name Node operations.
  - **Secondary Name Node**: Takes over if the primary fails, ensuring continuous operation.

---

#### **9. Key Takeaways**
- **HDFS**:
  - A distributed file system optimized for **big data storage**.
  - Uses **rack awareness** and **replication** for performance and fault tolerance.
  - Not strongly consistent in failure scenarios.
- **Name Node**:
  - Manages metadata and optimizes data placement.
  - High availability is achieved using **Zookeeper** and a secondary Name Node.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Ideal for **batch processing** and **large-scale data storage**.
  - Used as a foundation for databases like **HBase** and frameworks like **MapReduce** and **Spark**.

---

#### **10. Conclusion**
- **Hadoop** and **HDFS** are foundational technologies for big data storage and processing.
- HDFS provides **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **rack-aware optimizations**.
- In the next video, weâ€™ll explore **HBase**, a database built on top of HDFS, and its use cases.
