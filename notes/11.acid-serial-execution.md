#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Actual Serial Execution, a method for achieving **serializability** in databases by executing transactions one at a time on a single core.
- **Goal**: Understand how actual serial execution works, its benefits, and the optimizations required to make it performant.

---

#### **2. What is Actual Serial Execution?**
- **Definition**: A database execution model where transactions are processed **one at a time** on a **single core**, ensuring full serializability.
- **Key Idea**: By avoiding concurrent execution, race conditions and isolation issues are eliminated.
- **Example**: VoltDB is a real-world database that uses actual serial execution.

---

#### **3. Why Use Actual Serial Execution?**
- **Challenge**: Achieving **serializability** (full isolation) in multi-threaded databases is complex and can degrade performance.
- **Solution**: Execute transactions sequentially on a single core, ensuring no overlap or interference.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies isolation and eliminates race conditions.

#### **4. Optimizations for Actual Serial Execution**
- **1. In-Memory Databases**:
  - **Why**: Disk access is slow. Keeping data in memory speeds up reads and writes.
  - **Trade-Offs**:
    - **Pros**: Faster access, supports efficient indexing (e.g., hash indexes, binary search trees).
    - **Cons**: Limited by memory size, less durable (data is lost if the system crashes).
  - **Durability**: Use a **write-ahead log (WAL)** to ensure data persistence, but this reintroduces disk I/O.

- **2. Minimize Network Overhead**:
  - **Why**: Sending large SQL scripts over the network is slow and can bottleneck performance.
  - **Solution**: Use **stored procedures**.
    - **How It Works**:
      1. Preload SQL functions (stored procedures) onto the database.
      2. Send only the **parameters** (e.g., product ID, quantity) instead of the entire script.
      3. Example: Instead of sending a 2KB SQL script, send two 32-bit integers (product ID and quantity).
    - **Pros**: Reduces network traffic, speeds up transaction processing.
    - **Cons**: Harder to manage (e.g., version control, deployment across replicas).

---

#### **5. Challenges of Actual Serial Execution**
- **Single-Core Bottleneck**:
  - All transactions are processed on one core, limiting scalability.
  - Optimizations (e.g., in-memory storage, stored procedures) are necessary to maximize performance.
- **Durability**:
  - In-memory databases are less durable. A crash can result in data loss unless a WAL is used.
- **Developer Experience**:
  - Stored procedures are harder to manage and integrate with application code.

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Actual Serial Execution**:
  - Executes transactions one at a time on a single core.
  - Ensures full serializability and eliminates race conditions.
- **Optimizations**:
  - Use **in-memory databases** for faster access.
  - Use **stored procedures** to minimize network overhead.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Limited by single-core performance and memory size.
  - Requires careful management of stored procedures and durability mechanisms.
