#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Column-Oriented Storage, a database storage format optimized for analytical queries.
- **Goal**: Understand how column-oriented storage works, its benefits, and how it compares to row-oriented storage.

#### **2. What is Column-Oriented Storage?**
- **Definition**: A storage format where data is stored by columns rather than rows.
- **Key Idea**: Values from the same column are stored contiguously on disk, making it efficient for analytical queries that operate on specific columns.
- **Comparison to Row-Oriented Storage**:
  - **Row-Oriented**: Stores all fields of a row together (e.g., name, email, company).
  - **Column-Oriented**: Stores all values of a column together (e.g., all names in one file, all emails in another).

#### **3. Benefits of Column-Oriented Storage**
1. **Efficient for Analytical Queries**:
   - **Example**: Calculating aggregates (min, max, average, sum) on a single column.
   - **Why**: Data for a single column is stored together, reducing disk seek time.
2. **Column Compression**:
   - **Why**: Columns often contain repetitive or similar values, making them highly compressible.
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Bitmap Encoding**: Represents values as bits (e.g., 0 for false, 1 for true).
     - **Run-Length Encoding**: Compresses sequences of repeated values (e.g., "000111" becomes "3,3").
     - **Dictionary Compression**: Maps unique values to smaller bit representations (e.g., club names to 3-bit codes).
3. **Predicate Pushdown**:
   - **Definition**: A technique where metadata (e.g., min, max) is used to skip irrelevant data during queries.
   - **Example**: If a query filters for values > 60, and a fileâ€™s max value is 55, the file is skipped.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces the amount of data read, speeding up queries.

#### **4. How Column-Oriented Storage Works**
- **Data Layout**:
  - Each column is stored in a separate file (e.g., `names.txt`, `emails.txt`).
  - Values within a column are stored in the same order to maintain row alignment.
- **Compression Example**:
  - **Column**: Number of rejections at a club (values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
  - **Bitmap Encoding**: Represents each value as a sequence of bits.
  - **Run-Length Encoding**: Compresses sequences of repeated bits (e.g., "000111" becomes "3,3").
  - **Dictionary Compression**: Maps unique values (e.g., club names) to smaller bit representations.
- **Predicate Pushdown Example**:
  - **Query**: Find rows where column value > 60.
  - **Metadata**: File 1 (min: 60, max: 80), File 2 (min: 40, max: 55).
  - **Action**: Skip File 2 because its max value (55) is less than 60.

#### **5. Challenges of Column-Oriented Storage**
1. **Sort Order**:
   - All columns must maintain the same sort order to ensure row alignment.
   - **Workaround**: Duplicate data with different sort orders, but this increases storage overhead.
2. **Write Overhead**:
   - Writing a single row requires updating multiple column files.
   - **Solution**: Use an **LSM Tree** (Log-Structured Merge Tree) to batch writes:
     - **Step 1**: Write rows to an in-memory LSM tree.
     - **Step 2**: Periodically flush the LSM tree to disk in column-oriented format.
     - **Benefit**: Reduces the number of disk writes and avoids costly in-place updates.

#### **6. When to Use Column-Oriented Storage**
- **Analytical Workloads**:
  - Queries that operate on specific columns (e.g., aggregations, filtering).
  - **Example**: Data science, business intelligence, and reporting.
- **Low Write Frequency**:
  - Best for read-heavy workloads with infrequent writes.
  - **Example**: Data warehouses, historical data analysis.
