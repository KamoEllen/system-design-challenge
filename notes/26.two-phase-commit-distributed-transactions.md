#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Two-Phase Commit (2PC) in distributed systems.
- **Goal**: Understand how 2PC ensures atomicity in distributed transactions and its challenges.

---

#### **2. Why Two-Phase Commit?**
- **Problem**: In distributed systems, writes often need to go to multiple nodes (e.g., cross-partition writes or global secondary indexes).
- **Challenge**: If one write succeeds and another fails, the system becomes inconsistent.
- **Solution**: Two-Phase Commit ensures that either all writes succeed (commit) or all fail (abort), maintaining atomicity.

#### **3. How Two-Phase Commit Works**
- **Participants**:
  1. **Coordinator Node**: Manages the transaction (e.g., an application server).
  2. **Participant Nodes**: Database nodes that perform the actual writes.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Prepare Phase**:
     - The coordinator sends a "prepare" message to all participant nodes.
     - Each participant checks if it can commit the transaction (e.g., checks for conflicts, space, etc.).
     - If ready, the participant locks the relevant rows and responds with "OK."
     - If not ready, the participant responds with "No."
  2. **Commit Phase**:
     - If all participants respond "OK," the coordinator sends a "commit" message.
     - Participants commit the transaction, write to their logs, and release locks.
     - If any participant responds "No," the coordinator sends an "abort" message, and participants roll back the transaction.

#### **4. Example of Two-Phase Commit**
- **Scenario**:
  - Coordinator sends "prepare" messages to Node 1 and Node 2.
  - Node 1 responds "OK" and locks the relevant rows.
  - Node 2 responds "No" due to a conflict.
  - Coordinator sends "abort" to Node 1, which releases the locks.
- **Successful Commit**:
  - Both nodes respond "OK."
  - Coordinator sends "commit" messages.
  - Nodes commit the transaction and release locks.

---

#### **5. Challenges of Two-Phase Commit**
1. **Single Point of Failure**:
   - If the coordinator fails after sending "prepare" but before sending "commit," the participants remain in a blocked state with locks held.
   - Solution: The coordinator must log the transaction state to recover after a failure.
2. **Blocking Locks**:
   - Participants hold locks during the prepare phase, blocking other transactions.
   - This can lead to performance bottlenecks.
3. **Participant Failure**:
   - If a participant fails after responding "OK," the coordinator must retry until the participant recovers and completes the commit.
4. **Lack of Fault Tolerance**:
   - 2PC is not resilient to network partitions or multiple failures.

---

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Two-Phase Commit**:
  - Ensures atomicity in distributed transactions.
  - Works in two phases: prepare and commit.
- **Pros**:
  - Guarantees that all participants either commit or abort.
- **Cons**:
  - Single point of failure (coordinator).
  - Blocking locks can degrade performance.
  - Not fault-tolerant in the face of network partitions or multiple failures.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- Two-Phase Commit is a fundamental protocol for ensuring atomicity in distributed transactions but has significant limitations.
- It is best used when cross-partition writes or global secondary indexes are unavoidable.
- In the next video, weâ€™ll explore **distributed consensus** protocols (e.g., Paxos, Raft) that improve fault tolerance and scalability.
