#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Two-Phase Locking (2PL), a concurrency control mechanism used to achieve **serializability** in databases.
- **Goal**: Understand how 2PL works, its benefits, and the challenges it introduces (e.g., deadlocks, phantoms).

---

#### **2. What is Two-Phase Locking?**
- **Definition**: A locking protocol where transactions acquire and release locks in **two phases**:
  1. **Growing Phase**: Acquire locks (read or write) on required rows.
  2. **Shrinking Phase**: Release locks after completing the transaction.
- **Key Idea**: Ensures transactions do not interfere with each other, maintaining **serializability**.

---

#### **3. Types of Locks in 2PL**
- **Shared Locks (Read Locks)**:
  - Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same row.
  - Prevents writers from modifying the row while readers are accessing it.
- **Exclusive Locks (Write Locks)**:
  - Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a row.
  - Prevents other transactions from reading or writing the row.

#### **4. How 2PL Works**
- **Example**:
  - **Transaction 1 (T1)**: Reads and updates Jordan's shopping cart.
  - **Transaction 2 (T2)**: Reads and updates Snoop Dogg's shopping cart.
- **Steps**:
  1. T1 acquires a **shared lock** on Jordan's row and Snoop Dogg's row.
  2. T2 acquires a **shared lock** on Snoop Dogg's row and Jordan's row.
  3. T1 attempts to upgrade its lock on Jordan's row to an **exclusive lock** but is blocked because T2 holds a shared lock.
  4. T2 attempts to upgrade its lock on Snoop Dogg's row to an **exclusive lock** but is blocked because T1 holds a shared lock.
  5. **Deadlock**: Both transactions are blocked, waiting for each other to release locks.

---

#### **5. Challenges with 2PL**
- **Deadlocks**:
  - Occur when transactions wait indefinitely for locks held by each other.
  - **Solution**: Detect and resolve deadlocks by aborting one of the transactions.
- **Performance Overhead**:
  - Acquiring and releasing locks adds latency.
  - Deadlock detection and resolution further slow down the system.
- **Phantoms**:
  - New rows inserted by other transactions can violate invariants.
  - **Example**: Two transactions read a class roster (e.g., "Flexibility at 6 PM") and both attempt to enroll, exceeding the class capacity.

---

#### **6. Preventing Phantoms**
- **Predicate Locks**:
  - Lock all rows that match a condition (e.g., `WHERE class_name = 'Flexibility' AND class_time = '6 PM'`).
  - **Challenge**: Expensive to evaluate and maintain.
- **Index Range Locks**:
  - Lock a range of rows using an index (e.g., lock all rows for the "Flexibility" class).
  - **Trade-Off**: Locks more rows than necessary but is faster to execute.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**:
  - Ensures serializability by acquiring and releasing locks in two phases.
  - Uses **shared locks** for reads and **exclusive locks** for writes.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Deadlocks**: Transactions block each other, requiring detection and resolution.
  - **Phantoms**: New rows can violate invariants, requiring **predicate locks** or **index range locks**.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Provides strong isolation but introduces performance overhead.
