#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Redis and Memcached, two popular distributed caching systems.
- **Goal**: Understand the differences, use cases, and trade-offs between Redis and Memcached.

---

#### **2. Why Use Distributed Caching?**
- **Problem**: Local caching (e.g., on application servers) is limited by the deviceâ€™s capacity.
- **Solution**: Distributed caching systems like **Redis** and **Memcached** scale independently, allowing for flexible cache capacity and performance.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Scalability**: Add more cache nodes as needed.
  - **Performance**: Faster access to frequently requested data.
  - **Reduced Load**: Offload repetitive queries from databases.

#### **3. Memcached**
- **Overview**: A simple, high-performance, distributed in-memory key-value store.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Partitioning**: Uses **consistent hashing** to distribute data across nodes.
     - Ensures the same key is always routed to the same node.
  2. **Multi-Threading**: Handles multiple requests concurrently.
  3. **Eviction Policy**: Uses **Least Recently Used (LRU)** for cache eviction.
     - Implemented with a **doubly linked list + hashmap** for O(1) access and eviction.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and lightweight.
  - Easy to scale horizontally.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited functionality (basic key-value store).
  - No built-in support for advanced data structures or transactions.

#### **4. Redis**
- **Overview**: A feature-rich, in-memory data store supporting advanced data structures and transactions.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Data Structures**: Supports **hashes**, **sorted sets**, **geo indexes**, and more.
  2. **Partitioning**: Uses a **fixed number of partitions** with a **gossip protocol** for node communication.
     - If a node fails, its partitions are redistributed to other nodes.
  3. **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**: Ensures **atomicity** by logging operations before committing them to memory.
  4. **Single-Threaded Execution**: Ensures **isolation** by processing requests serially.
  5. **Single-Leader Replication**: Built-in support for replication, but limited to a single leader.
- **Pros**:
  - Rich feature set (e.g., transactions, advanced data structures).
  - Fault tolerance with WAL and partition redistribution.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited to single-leader replication.
  - More complex than Memcached.

#### **5. Key Differences**
| **Feature**              | **Memcached**                          | **Redis**                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Data Structures**       | Basic key-value store.                 | Advanced (hashes, sorted sets, etc.).  |
| **Partitioning**          | Consistent hashing.                    | Fixed partitions with gossip protocol. |
| **Concurrency**           | Multi-threaded.                        | Single-threaded (ensures isolation).   |
| **Eviction Policy**       | LRU (Least Recently Used).             | Configurable (LRU, LFU, etc.).         |
| **Transactions**          | Not supported.                         | Supported (ACID guarantees).           |
| **Replication**           | Not built-in (requires custom setup).  | Single-leader replication.             |

#### **6. Use Cases**
- **Memcached**:
  - Ideal for simple caching needs (e.g., session storage, query caching).
  - Best for applications requiring high throughput and low latency with minimal complexity.
- **Redis**:
  - Suitable for applications needing advanced data structures (e.g., leaderboards, geospatial data).
  - Ideal for systems requiring transactions or atomic operations.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- **Memcached**:
  - Simple, lightweight, and scalable.
  - Best for basic caching needs.
- **Redis**:
  - Feature-rich with support for advanced data structures and transactions.
  - Best for complex caching and data processing requirements.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Choose **Memcached** for simplicity and performance.
  - Choose **Redis** for advanced functionality and data guarantees.
