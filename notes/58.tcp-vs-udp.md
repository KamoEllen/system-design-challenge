#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: TCP vs. UDP, two protocols used for sending messages over the internet.
- **Goal**: Understand the differences between TCP and UDP, including flow control, congestion control, and their use cases.

---

#### **2. What are TCP and UDP?**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
  - A reliable, two-way communication protocol.
  - Ensures data is delivered accurately and in order.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
  - A simple, fast, and barebones protocol.
  - Does not guarantee delivery or order of packets.

#### **3. What is UDP?**
- **Definition**: A lightweight protocol for sending packets over an IP network.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Simplicity**: No handshake or connection setup required.
  - **Speed**: Extremely fast due to minimal overhead.
  - **Checksums**: Ensures data integrity by detecting corrupted packets.
  - **Multicast Support**: Allows one packet to be sent to multiple nodes simultaneously.
- **Limitations**:
  - No guarantees on packet delivery or order.
  - No flow or congestion control, which can lead to network overload.

#### **4. What is TCP?**
- **Definition**: A reliable, connection-oriented protocol for sending data over networks.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Three-Way Handshake**: Ensures a connection is established before data transfer.
    - **Steps**:
      1. Sender sends a SYN packet with a sequence number (e.g., X).
      2. Receiver responds with SYN-ACK (X+1) and its own sequence number (Y).
      3. Sender acknowledges with ACK (Y+1).
  - **Reliable Delivery**: Uses sequence numbers and acknowledgements to ensure data is received.
  - **Flow Control**: Prevents overwhelming the receiver’s buffer.
  - **Congestion Control**: Prevents network overload by adjusting the sending rate.

---

#### **5. Reliable Delivery in TCP**
- **Sequence Numbers**: Track the order of packets and ensure no data is lost.
- **Acknowledgements**: Confirm receipt of packets.
  - If a packet is not acknowledged, it is retransmitted after a timeout.
- **Timeout and Retransmission**:
  - If no acknowledgement is received, TCP retransmits the packet.
  - Uses **exponential backoff** to avoid spamming the network (e.g., wait 5s, then 10s, then 20s).

---

#### **6. Flow Control**
- **Definition**: Ensures the sender does not overwhelm the receiver’s buffer.
- **How It Works**:
  - The receiver advertises its available buffer space.
  - The sender limits the number of in-flight messages to match the buffer size.
  - Example: If the buffer size is 10 and 2 messages are in flight, the sender can send up to 8 more.

---

#### **7. Congestion Control**
- **Definition**: Prevents network overload by adjusting the sender’s transmission rate.
- **How It Works**:
  - **Window Size**: The number of in-flight messages allowed.
  - **Additive Increase**: Gradually increase the window size when the network is stable.
  - **Multiplicative Decrease**: Quickly reduce the window size if congestion is detected.
  - **AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease)**: The algorithm used to balance network load.

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **UDP**:
  - Fast, simple, and lightweight.
  - No guarantees on delivery or order.
  - Ideal for real-time applications (e.g., video calls, gaming, stock prices).
- **TCP**:
  - Reliable, connection-oriented, and feature-rich.
  - Ensures data integrity, order, and delivery.
  - Ideal for applications where data accuracy is critical (e.g., web apps, file transfers).
- **Flow Control**: Prevents receiver overload.
- **Congestion Control**: Prevents network overload.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
- **TCP** is the go-to protocol for reliable communication but comes with higher overhead.
- **UDP** is faster and simpler, making it suitable for real-time applications where occasional data loss is acceptable.
- Understanding the trade-offs between TCP and UDP helps in choosing the right protocol for specific use cases.
