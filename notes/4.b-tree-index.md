#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: B-Trees, how they work, and their advantages in databases.
- **Comparison**: Unlike hash indexes (which are kept in memory), B-Trees are stored **on disk**, making them more scalable and durable.

---

#### **2. What is a B-Tree?**
- **Definition**: A **self-balancing tree** structure used as a database index.
- **Key Features**:
  - **On-Disk Storage**: Entirely stored on disk, unlike hash indexes.
  - **Range Queries**: Efficiently supports range queries (e.g., find all keys between "A" and "B").
  - **Balanced Structure**: Ensures the tree remains balanced, keeping operations efficient.

---

#### **3. Structure of a B-Tree**
- **Tree-Like Structure**:
  - **Nodes**: Each node contains a range of keys and pointers to child nodes.
  - **Leaf Nodes**: Contain actual data or references to data on disk.
- **Example**:
  - **Keys**: Names and scores (e.g., "Adam: 85", "Bob: 90", "Edward: 80").
  - **Pointers**: Guide traversal to the correct leaf node.
  - **Visualization**:
    ```
    Root Node: [A - E] → [E - O] → [O - Z]
    Leaf Nodes:
      - [Adam: 85, Bob: 90]
      - [Edward: 80, Gordon: 95]
      - [Olivia: 88, Zoe: 92]
    ```

#### **4. How B-Trees Work**
- **Traversal**:
  - Start at the root node.
  - Follow pointers based on the key range.
  - Traverse down to the appropriate leaf node.
- **Example**:
  - Query: Find "Edward."
  - Traversal: Root → [E - O] → Leaf Node (Edward: 80).

- **Balanced Nature**:
  - Ensures the tree height remains **logarithmic** relative to the number of keys.
  - Keeps read operations efficient (few disk accesses).

---

#### **5. Advantages of B-Trees**
1. **Scalability**:
   - No need to keep all keys in memory (unlike hash indexes).
   - Can handle **large datasets** that exceed memory capacity.
2. **Range Queries**:
   - Efficiently retrieves keys within a range (e.g., names between "A" and "B").
   - Example: Fetch all scores between 80 and 90.
3. **Balanced Structure**:
   - Ensures consistent performance for reads and writes.

#### **6. Inserting Data into a B-Tree**
- **Process**:
  1. Traverse the tree to find the correct leaf node.
  2. Insert the new key into the leaf node.
  3. If the leaf node is full, **split it**:
     - Divide the node into two.
     - Update the parent node to reflect the new split.
     - If the parent node is full, repeat the process up to the root.
- **Example**:
  - Insert "Betty: 90" into a leaf node containing "Adam: 85" and "Bob: 90."
  - If the node is full, split it into:
    - Node 1: [Adam: 85, Betty: 90]
    - Node 2: [Bob: 90]

---

#### **7. Handling Failures with Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**
- **Problem**: If the system crashes during a B-Tree update, the tree may become inconsistent.
- **Solution**: Use a **write-ahead log (WAL)**.
  - **How It Works**:
    1. Record all changes in the WAL before updating the B-Tree.
    2. If the system crashes, replay the WAL to restore the B-Tree to a consistent state.
  - **Example**:
    - WAL Entry: "Insert Betty: 90 into Node X."
    - Replay the log to ensure the update is applied.

---

#### **8. Performance of B-Trees**
- **Reads**:
  - **O(log n)**: Efficient due to the balanced tree structure.
  - Few disk accesses required to traverse the tree.
- **Writes**:
  - **Slower than Reads**: May require splitting nodes and updating multiple levels of the tree.
  - **Write-Ahead Log**: Adds overhead but ensures durability.

#### **9. Comparison with Hash Indexes**
| **Aspect**         | **B-Tree**                          | **Hash Index**                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Storage**         | On disk                            | In memory                          |
| **Range Queries**   | Supported (efficient)              | Not supported                      |
| **Scalability**     | Handles large datasets             | Limited by memory size             |
| **Read Speed**      | O(log n)                           | O(1)                               |
| **Write Speed**     | Slower (due to splitting nodes)    | O(1)                               |
| **Durability**      | Uses WAL for consistency           | Requires WAL for durability        |
