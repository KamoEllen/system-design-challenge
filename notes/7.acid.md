#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: ACID transactions and their role in ensuring database reliability.
- **Goal**: Understand the four properties of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and how they are implemented in databases.

#### **2. What are ACID Transactions?**
- **Definition**: A set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions.
- **Purpose**: Ensure data integrity and consistency, even in the face of errors or failures.
- **ACID Acronym**:
  - **A**: Atomicity
  - **C**: Consistency
  - **I**: Isolation
  - **D**: Durability

---

#### **3. Atomicity**
- **Definition**: A transaction is **atomic** if it is treated as a single, indivisible unit.
- **Key Idea**: Either **all** operations in the transaction succeed, or **none** do.
- **Example**:
  - Transfer $10 from Jordan to Karnov.
  - **Success**: Both the debit (Jordan loses $10) and credit (Karnov gains $10) succeed.
  - **Failure**: If either operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back (no money is transferred).
- **Importance**: Prevents partial updates that could lead to data inconsistencies.

---

#### **4. Consistency**
- **Definition**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one **valid state** to another.
- **Key Idea**: Database invariants (rules) must be maintained before and after the transaction.
- **Example**:
  - A security guard database must always have **one guard on duty**.
  - Transaction: Replace Larry with Oscar.
  - **Consistency Check**: Ensure there is always one guard on duty during the transition.
- **Importance**: Prevents invalid states (e.g., no guard on duty).

---

#### **5. Isolation**
- **Definition**: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Key Idea**: Transactions are executed as if they were running **sequentially**, even if they are running concurrently.
- **Example**:
  - Two transactions increment a counter (initial value: 0).
  - **Without Isolation**:
    - Both transactions read 0, increment to 1, and write 1 (final value: 1 instead of 2).
  - **With Isolation**:
    - Transactions are executed one after the other, ensuring the final value is 2.
- **Importance**: Prevents **race conditions** and ensures correct results.

---

#### **6. Durability**
- **Definition**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are **permanent**.
- **Key Idea**: Data is saved to **non-volatile storage** (e.g., disk) and will survive system failures.
- **Example**:
  - After transferring $10, the changes are written to disk.
  - Even if the system crashes, the transaction remains intact.
- **Importance**: Guarantees that committed data is not lost.

---

#### **7. Implementing ACID with Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**
- **What is a WAL?**:
  - A log file that records all changes to the database **before** they are applied.
  - Ensures **atomicity** and **dubility**.
- **How It Works**:
  1. Log the transaction details (e.g., "Transfer $10 from Jordan to Karnov").
  2. Write a **commit** record to the log.
  3. Apply the changes to the database.
- **Recovery**:
  - If the system crashes, replay the WAL to restore the database to a consistent state.

---

#### **8. Challenges with Isolation**
- **Performance Trade-Off**:
  - Ensuring full isolation (serializability) can slow down the database.
  - Databases often use **weaker isolation levels** (e.g., Read Committed, Repeatable Read) to improve performance.
- **Example**:
  - **Read Committed**: Ensures that only committed data is read, but may allow **non-repeatable reads**.
  - **Serializable**: Ensures full isolation but is slower.

---

#### **9. Key Takeaways**
- **ACID Properties**:
  - **Atomicity**: All or nothing.
  - **Consistency**: Valid state before and after.
  - **Isolation**: No interference between transactions.
  - **Durability**: Changes are permanent.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**:
  - Ensures atomicity and durability by logging changes before applying them.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Full ACID compliance can impact performance.
  - Databases often use weaker isolation levels to balance performance and correctness.
