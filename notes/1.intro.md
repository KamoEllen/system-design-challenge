#### **1. What is Systems Design?**
- **Definition**: Systems design is the process of creating scalable, reliable, and efficient systems to handle large amounts of data and user requests.
- **Core Problem**: As a system grows (e.g., a social media platform like Facebook), storing and managing data on a single machine becomes insufficient.
- **Goal**: Design systems that can handle high traffic, store massive amounts of data, and remain reliable even in the face of failures.

#### **2. Client-Server Model**
- **Client**: The user or device making requests (e.g., you accessing Facebook).
- **Server**: The system that processes requests and returns data (e.g., Facebook’s application server).
- **Interaction**:
  - **Request**: Client asks for data (e.g., profile picture, posts).
  - **Response**: Server provides the requested data.
- **Example**: On Facebook, when you load your profile, your device (client) sends a request to Facebook’s servers, which return your profile data.

#### **3. Data Storage Basics**
- **Two Primary Storage Types**:
  1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
     - **Purpose**: Temporary storage for active computations.
     - **Use Case**: Storing variables, running processes, and active data.
     - **Characteristics**: 
       - Fast access.
       - Volatile (data is lost when power is off).
  2. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**:
     - **Purpose**: Permanent storage for data.
     - **Use Case**: Storing user data like profile pictures, posts, and other long-term information.
     - **Characteristics**:
       - Slower than RAM.
       - Non-volatile (data persists even when powered off).

- **Why Use HDD for Data Storage?**
  - Servers can shut down unexpectedly (e.g., power failure).
  - Data must persist even if the server restarts.
  - HDDs provide reliable, long-term storage.

#### **4. Scaling Data Storage**
- **Problem**: A single application server cannot handle all user requests and data storage needs as the system grows.
- **Solution**: Separate data storage from application servers using a **database**.
  - **Database**: A dedicated system for storing and managing data.
  - **Role**: Acts as the "sole source of truth" for all user data (e.g., profiles, posts).
  - **Interaction**: Application servers query the database for specific data.

- **Why Not Store Data on Application Servers?**
  - Application servers handle user requests, which can become a bottleneck.
  - Storing data on application servers limits scalability (e.g., if data is stored on one server, other servers won’t have access to it).
  - Databases allow centralized, scalable data storage.

#### **5. Challenges in Systems Design**
- **Scalability**:
  - **Problem**: As the number of users grows, one database may not be enough.
  - **Solution**: Split data across multiple databases (e.g., sharding, partitioning).
- **Reliability**:
  - **Problem**: If a database fails, data becomes inaccessible.
  - **Solution**: Implement fault-tolerant systems (e.g., backups, replication).
- **Performance**:
  - **Problem**: Fetching and storing data must be fast for a good user experience.
  - **Solution**: Use techniques like caching, indexing, and load balancing.

#### **6. Systems Design Interview Focus**
- **Approach**: Start from the database layer and move outward to the client layer.
  - **Database Layer**: Focus on data storage, retrieval, and scalability.
  - **Application Layer**: Focus on handling user requests, caching, and performance optimization.
- **Key Concepts to Cover**:
  - **Caching**: Temporarily storing data to reduce load on databases.
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributing user requests across multiple servers.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Ensuring system reliability through redundancy and backups.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- Systems design is about creating systems that are **scalable**, **reliable**, and **efficient**.
- The **client-server model** is fundamental, with databases playing a crucial role in data management.
- **Data storage** involves balancing speed (RAM) and persistence (HDD).
- **Scalability** and **fault tolerance** are critical challenges in systems design.
- The series will progressively cover advanced topics like caching, load balancing, and database optimization.
