#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Detecting concurrent writes in a multi-leader replication setup.
- **Goal**: Understand how to detect and resolve concurrent writes, and compare this approach to "last write wins" strategies.

---

#### **2. What is Multi-Leader Replication?**
- **Definition**: A replication strategy where multiple nodes (leaders) can handle write operations independently.
- **Key Idea**: Increases write throughput but introduces the risk of write conflicts (e.g., concurrent writes to the same data).

---

#### **3. The Problem with Timestamps**
- **Issue**: Using timestamps to resolve conflicts (e.g., "last write wins") is unreliable due to clock skew and synchronization issues.
- **Solution**: A better approach is needed to detect and resolve concurrent writes.

---

#### **4. Distributed Counter Example**
- **Scenario**: Two leaders (left and right) increment a counter independently.
  - Left leader: Count = 3.
  - Right leader: Count = 5.
- **Conflict**: When the leaders exchange values, they need to merge the counts correctly.
- **Naive Solution**: Set the counter to the higher value (e.g., 5), but this is incorrect because the true value should be the sum of both increments (e.g., 8).

---

#### **5. Concurrent Writes**
- **Definition**: Writes are concurrent if they occur without knowledge of each other (even if they happen at slightly different times).
- **Example**: Two users incrementing the same counter on different leaders without seeing each other's updates.

---

#### **6. Version Vectors**
- **Definition**: A data structure that tracks the number of writes seen from each leader.
- **How It Works**:
  - Each leader maintains a version vector (e.g., [left writes, right writes]).
  - Example:
    - Left leader: Version Vector = [3, 0], Counter = 3.
    - Right leader: Version Vector = [0, 5], Counter = 5.
  - When leaders exchange data, they merge their version vectors and update the counter accordingly (e.g., [3, 5] → Counter = 8).

---

#### **7. Handling Incremental Updates**
- **Scenario**: Left leader increments the counter by 1 (Counter = 9, Version Vector = [4, 5]).
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Right leader receives the update and merges the version vectors.
  - Only the new increment (1) is added to the counter (e.g., 8 + 1 = 9).

---

#### **8. Detecting Concurrent Writes with Version Vectors**
- **Rule**: If one version vector is strictly greater than or equal to another, the writes are not concurrent.
- **Example**:
  - Version Vector A = [2, 1, 2].
  - Version Vector B = [1, 1, 1].
  - A is strictly greater than B, so the writes are not concurrent.
- **Concurrent Writes**:
  - If version vectors are interleaved (e.g., [5, 2] vs. [4, 3]), the writes are concurrent.

---

#### **9. Resolving Concurrent Writes**
1. **Option 1: Store Siblings**:
   - Store both conflicting values and let the application or user resolve the conflict.
   - Example:
     - Key = "Jordan", Value = ["cute", "scary"].
     - The user chooses the correct value during a read operation.
2. **Option 2: Merge Automatically**:
   - Use Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to automatically resolve conflicts.
   - Example: A counter CRDT merges version vectors to compute the correct value.

---

#### **10. Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**
- **Definition**: Data structures designed to handle concurrent writes without conflicts.
- **Examples**:
  - Counters: Merge version vectors to compute the correct count.
  - Sets: Automatically merge additions and deletions.
- **Use Case**: Simplifies conflict resolution in distributed systems.

---

#### **11. Key Takeaways**
- **Multi-Leader Replication**:
  - Increases write throughput but introduces write conflicts.
- **Version Vectors**:
  - Track writes from each leader to detect concurrent writes.
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Store siblings for manual resolution or use CRDTs for automatic merging.
- **CRDTs**:
  - Enable conflict-free merging of concurrent writes for specific data types.

---

#### **12. Conclusion**
- Detecting and resolving concurrent writes is critical in multi-leader replication systems.
- Version vectors provide a reliable way to detect concurrent writes, while CRDTs offer automated conflict resolution.
- In the next video, we’ll dive deeper into CRDTs and explore leaderless replication.
