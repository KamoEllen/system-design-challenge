#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Load Balancing, a technique for distributing workloads across multiple servers to optimize resource use and ensure fault tolerance.
- **Goal**: Understand the principles of load balancing, routing policies, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

#### **2. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**
1. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - **Definition**: Increasing the capacity of a single server (e.g., more CPU, RAM).
   - **Pros**: Simple to implement.
   - **Cons**: Limited by hardware constraints; expensive at scale.
2. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - **Definition**: Adding more servers to distribute the workload.
   - **Pros**: Scalable and cost-effective using commodity hardware.
   - **Cons**: Requires load balancing to distribute requests evenly.

#### **3. What is Load Balancing?**
- **Definition**: A system that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Between clients and application servers.
  - Between application servers and caching layers.
  - Between caching layers and databases.
- **Key Idea**: Ensure no single server is overwhelmed while maintaining efficient resource utilization.

#### **4. Routing Policies**
1. **Round Robin**:
   - **Definition**: Distributes requests evenly across servers in a cyclic order.
   - **Example**: Request 1 → Server 1, Request 2 → Server 2, Request 3 → Server 3, Request 4 → Server 1.
   - **Pros**: Simple and fair distribution.
   - **Cons**: Ignores server load or capacity.

2. **Weighted Round Robin**:
   - **Definition**: Assigns weights to servers based on capacity (e.g., more powerful servers handle more requests).
   - **Example**: Server 1 (2x capacity) handles 2 requests, Server 2 handles 1 request.
   - **Pros**: Accounts for server capacity.
   - **Cons**: Still static; doesn’t adapt to real-time load.

3. **Least Response Time**:
   - **Definition**: Routes requests to the server with the lowest average response time.
   - **Pros**: Dynamically adapts to server performance.
   - **Cons**: Requires maintaining state on the load balancer.

4. **Hashing**:
   - **Definition**: Uses a hash function to map requests to servers.
   - **Types**:
     - **Layer 4**: Uses network-level information (e.g., IP address, protocol).
     - **Layer 7**: Uses application-level information (e.g., HTTP headers, payload).
   - **Pros**: Ensures consistent routing for caching (e.g., same user → same server).
   - **Cons**: Requires careful implementation to handle server additions/removals.

#### **5. Consistent Hashing**
- **Definition**: A hashing technique that minimizes rehashing when servers are added or removed.
- **How It Works**:
  1. Servers and keys are mapped to a ring (hash space).
  2. Each key is assigned to the next server in the ring.
  3. When a server is added or removed, only a small portion of keys are remapped.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for caching systems to ensure cache hits (e.g., same user → same server).
- **Example**:
  - Server 1: Keys A–C.
  - Server 2: Keys D–F.
  - Add Server 3: Only remap keys near Server 3.

#### **6. Fault Tolerance**
1. **Active-Active Load Balancing**:
   - **Definition**: Multiple load balancers handle requests simultaneously.
   - **Pros**: Higher throughput; no single point of failure.
   - **Cons**: Requires synchronization of state (e.g., response time metrics).

2. **Active-Passive Load Balancing**:
   - **Definition**: One load balancer is active; others are on standby.
   - **Pros**: Simpler state management.
   - **Cons**: Lower throughput; standby load balancers are idle until failure.

3. **Zookeeper for Fault Tolerance**:
   - **Role**: Monitors load balancers using heartbeats.
   - **Process**: If the active load balancer fails, Zookeeper promotes the passive one.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Essential for horizontal scaling to distribute workloads evenly.
  - Uses routing policies like Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Least Response Time, and Hashing.
- **Consistent Hashing**:
  - Ensures minimal rehashing when servers are added or removed.
  - Ideal for caching systems to maximize cache hits.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Achieved through Active-Active or Active-Passive load balancers.
  - Zookeeper can monitor and manage failover.

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
- **Load Balancers** are critical for ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient resource utilization in distributed systems.
- Choosing the right **routing policy** depends on the use case (e.g., Round Robin for simplicity, Consistent Hashing for caching).
- **Fault Tolerance** mechanisms like Active-Active or Active-Passive setups ensure system reliability.
