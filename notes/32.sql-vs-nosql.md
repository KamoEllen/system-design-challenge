#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases.
- **Goal**: Understand the differences between relational and non-relational databases, their use cases, and trade-offs.

#### **2. What are Relational Databases?**
- **Definition**: Databases that organize data into tables, where each table represents a specific data model.
- **Key Idea**: Relationships between tables are established using **foreign keys**.
- **Example**: Trains and Stations.
  - **Trains Table**: Contains train IDs and names (e.g., Red Line, Blue Line).
  - **Stations Table**: Contains station IDs and names (e.g., Broadway, Yankee Stadium).
  - **Train Stations Table**: Uses foreign keys to link trains to stations, representing a **many-to-many relationship**.
- **Normalized Data**: Each piece of data is stored once, and relationships are established using foreign keys.

#### **3. Downsides of Relational Databases**
1. **Poor Data Locality**:
   - Data is spread across multiple tables, which may be stored in different locations (e.g., different nodes in a cluster).
   - **Impact**:
     - **Reads**: Requires distributed reads, increasing latency.
     - **Writes**: May require distributed transactions (e.g., two-phase commit), which are slow.
2. **Complexity**:
   - Managing relationships and ensuring consistency across tables can be challenging.
   - Example: Adding a new train station requires writes to both the `stations` and `train_stations` tables.

#### **4. What are Non-Relational Databases?**
- **Definition**: Databases that store data in a denormalized format, often as key-value pairs or records.
- **Key Idea**: All related data is stored together in a single record, improving data locality.
- **Example**: Trains and Stations in a Non-Relational Database.
  - Each train (key) stores all its stations (values) in a single record.
  - Example: Red Line → [Broadway, Yankee Stadium, Your Mom].
- **Denormalized Data**: Data is repeated across records to avoid cross-partition reads.

#### **5. Trade-offs of Non-Relational Databases**
1. **Advantages**:
   - **Improved Data Locality**: Related data is stored together, reducing the need for distributed reads.
   - **Simpler Queries**: No need for joins; all required data is in one place.
2. **Disadvantages**:
   - **Data Redundancy**: Repeated data increases storage requirements.
   - **Complex Writes**: Updating data in multiple places (e.g., removing a station from multiple trains) may require distributed transactions.
   - **Less Flexibility**: May require loading more data than necessary, depending on the database implementation.

#### **6. When to Use Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases**
1. **Relational Databases**:
   - **Use Case**: When data has natural relationships (e.g., books and authors).
   - **Example**: A library system where books are linked to authors.
2. **Non-Relational Databases**:
   - **Use Case**: When data is disjoint and doesn’t require relationships (e.g., social media posts).
   - **Example**: A social media platform where posts are independent of each other.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **Relational Databases**:
  - Use tables and foreign keys to represent relationships.
  - Best for structured data with natural relationships.
  - Downsides include poor data locality and complex distributed transactions.
- **Non-Relational Databases**:
  - Store data in denormalized records for better locality.
  - Best for disjoint data or scenarios where relationships are not needed.
  - Downsides include data redundancy and complex writes.

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
- Choosing between relational and non-relational databases depends on how your data is organized and the types of queries you need to perform.
- Relational databases excel at managing structured data with relationships, while non-relational databases are better suited for disjoint data with high read performance requirements.
- In the next videos, we’ll explore specific examples of relational and non-relational databases to better understand their implementations and use cases.
