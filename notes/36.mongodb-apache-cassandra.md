#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: MongoDB vs. Cassandra.
- **Goal**: Understand the key differences between MongoDB and Cassandra, their use cases, and trade-offs.

---

#### **2. MongoDB Overview**
- **Definition**: A **document-oriented NoSQL database** that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Document Model**: Stores data as nested JSON structures, allowing for flexible schemas.
  - **ACID Transactions**: Supports ACID transactions for data integrity.
  - **Indexing**: Uses **B-tree indexes** for efficient reads.
  - **Replication**: Typically uses **single-leader replication** with sharding for better write throughput.
- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal for applications requiring **flexible schemas** and **ACID compliance**.
  - Example: Storing user profiles with varying attributes.

#### **3. Cassandra Overview**
- **Definition**: A **wide-column NoSQL database** designed for high availability and scalability.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Wide-Column Model**: Data is organized into rows with a **cluster key** and **sort key**, allowing for flexible column structures.
  - **Partitioning**: Uses **consistent hashing** and a **gossip protocol** to distribute data across nodes.
  - **Replication**: Uses **leaderless replication** with **quorum-based reads and writes**.
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Uses **last-write-wins (LWW)** to resolve write conflicts.
  - **Storage**: Uses **LSM trees** and **SSTables** for efficient writes.
- **Use Case**:
  - Ideal for applications requiring **high write throughput** and **scalability**.
  - Example: A chat application like Facebook Messenger, where messages are written frequently and read by chat ID.

#### **4. Key Differences**
1. **Data Model**:
   - **MongoDB**: Document-oriented (JSON-like structures).
   - **Cassandra**: Wide-column (rows with cluster and sort keys).
2. **Transactions**:
   - **MongoDB**: Supports **ACID transactions** and **distributed transactions**.
   - **Cassandra**: Does not fully support ACID transactions; best for single-row operations.
3. **Replication**:
   - **MongoDB**: Uses **single-leader replication**.
   - **Cassandra**: Uses **leaderless replication** with quorum-based consistency.
4. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - **MongoDB**: Ensures data integrity through ACID transactions.
   - **Cassandra**: Uses **last-write-wins (LWW)**, which can lead to lost writes due to clock drift.
5. **Storage**:
   - **MongoDB**: Uses **B-tree indexes** for balanced read/write performance.
   - **Cassandra**: Uses **LSM trees** and **SSTables** for optimized writes.

#### **5. When to Use MongoDB**
- **Use Case**:
  - Applications requiring **flexible schemas** and **ACID compliance**.
  - Example: E-commerce platforms where product attributes vary.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to use and well-documented.
  - Supports complex queries and transactions.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower write performance compared to Cassandra.

---

#### **6. When to Use Cassandra**
- **Use Case**:
  - Applications requiring **high write throughput** and **scalability**.
  - Example: Chat applications, IoT data ingestion.
- **Advantages**:
  - High availability and fault tolerance.
  - Optimized for write-heavy workloads.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited support for ACID transactions.
  - Risk of lost writes due to LWW conflict resolution.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **MongoDB**:
  - Best for applications requiring **flexible schemas** and **ACID compliance**.
  - Supports complex queries and transactions.
- **Cassandra**:
  - Best for **write-heavy** applications requiring **high scalability**.
  - Uses leaderless replication and LSM trees for optimized performance.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - MongoDB offers better data integrity but slower writes.
  - Cassandra offers high write throughput but weaker consistency guarantees.

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
- Choosing between **MongoDB** and **Cassandra** depends on your application’s requirements:
  - Use **MongoDB** for flexible schemas and ACID compliance.
  - Use **Cassandra** for high write throughput and scalability.
