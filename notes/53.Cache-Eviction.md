#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Cache Eviction Policies, strategies for managing cache data when storage limits are reached.
- **Goal**: Understand the trade-offs between different eviction policies and their implementations.

---

#### **2. Why Cache Evictions Are Necessary**
- **Problem**: Caches use faster, more expensive storage (e.g., memory), which has limited capacity.
- **Solution**: When the cache is full, old data must be evicted to make space for new data.
- **Objective**: Minimize cache misses by evicting the least useful data.

#### **3. Cache Eviction Policies**
1. **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**:
   - **Definition**: Evicts the oldest data in the cache, regardless of usage.
   - **Implementation**: Uses a queue.
     - New entries are added to the tail.
     - Old entries are removed from the head.
   - **Example**:
     - Cache entries: [Jordan, Gorav, Joe Rogan, PewDiePie].
     - New entry: [Gorav].
     - Evict: [Jordan].
   - **Pros**: Simple to implement.
   - **Cons**: Ignores how frequently or recently data is accessed, leading to suboptimal evictions.

2. **Least Recently Used (LRU)**:
   - **Definition**: Evicts the data that hasn’t been accessed for the longest time.
   - **Implementation**: Uses a **hashmap + doubly linked list**.
     - **Hashmap**: Maps keys to nodes in the linked list.
     - **Doubly Linked List**: Maintains the order of access (most recent at the head, least recent at the tail).
   - **Example**:
     - Cache entries: [Jordan (recently accessed), Gorav, Joe Rogan, PewDiePie].
     - New entry: [Gorav].
     - Evict: [PewDiePie] (least recently used).
   - **Pros**: Better performance for frequently accessed data.
   - **Cons**: Slightly more complex to implement than FIFO.

3. **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**:
   - **Definition**: Evicts the data that has been accessed the least number of times.
   - **Implementation**: Uses **multiple doubly linked lists + hashmaps**.
     - Each linked list represents a frequency level (e.g., accessed 1 time, 2 times, etc.).
     - Hashmaps track the frequency of each cache entry.
   - **Example**:
     - Cache entries: [Jordan (accessed 8 times), Gorav (accessed 4 times), Joe Rogan (accessed 4 times), PewDiePie (accessed 6 times)].
     - New entry: [Gorav].
     - Evict: [Joe Rogan] (least frequently used).
   - **Pros**: Prioritizes frequently accessed data.
   - **Cons**: Complex implementation; may not handle sudden changes in access patterns well.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **FIFO**:
  - Simple but inefficient for dynamic access patterns.
  - Evicts data based on insertion order, not usage.
- **LRU**:
  - Balances simplicity and performance.
  - Evicts data based on recent access patterns.
- **LFU**:
  - Prioritizes frequently accessed data.
  - More complex to implement but useful for stable access patterns.

#### **5. Conclusion**
- **Cache Eviction Policies**:
  - Essential for managing limited cache storage.
  - The choice of policy depends on the application’s access patterns and performance requirements.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Explore advanced caching strategies like **adaptive replacement caching (ARC)**.
  - Dive deeper into **distributed caching** and **consistency models**.
