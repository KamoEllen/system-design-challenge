#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: LSM Trees (Log-Structured Merge Trees) and SSTables (Sorted String Tables).
- **Goal**: Understand how LSM Trees optimize database performance for large datasets, balancing speed and storage efficiency.

---

#### **2. What is an LSM Tree?**
- **Definition**: A database index structure that combines **in-memory** and **on-disk** components for efficient reads and writes.
- **Key Components**:
  1. **In-Memory Tree**: A balanced binary search tree (e.g., Red-Black Tree, AVL Tree, or B-Tree) used for fast writes.
  2. **On-Disk SSTables**: Immutable, sorted files created when the in-memory tree grows too large.

---

#### **3. Structure of an LSM Tree**
- **In-Memory Tree**:
  - Stores recent writes in a balanced binary search tree.
  - **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for reads and writes.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    Tree Structure:
        Bob: 90
       /     \
    Adam:85  Chuck:88
    ```
- **SSTables**:
  - Sorted files on disk created by flushing the in-memory tree.
  - **Immutable**: Once written, SSTables are not modified.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    SSTable 1: [Adam:85, Bob:90, Chuck:88]
    SSTable 2: [Dan:92, Edward:80]
    ```

#### **4. How LSM Trees Work**
- **Writes**:
  1. Write to the **in-memory tree** (fast, O(log n)).
  2. Periodically flush the in-memory tree to disk as an **SSTable**.
  3. Use a **write-ahead log (WAL)** for durability (logs changes before applying them).
- **Reads**:
  1. Check the **in-memory tree** first.
  2. If the key is not found, search the **SSTables** in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
  3. Use **binary search** on SSTables for efficient lookups (O(log n)).

---

#### **5. Handling Deletions and Updates**
- **Deletions**:
  - Use a **tombstone** marker to indicate a deleted key.
  - Example:
    ```
    Key: Jordan, Value: <Tombstone>
    ```
- **Updates**:
  - Write a new entry with the updated value.
  - The most recent entry (in the in-memory tree or the latest SSTable) takes precedence.

---

#### **6. Optimizations for LSM Trees**
1. **Sparse Index**:
   - Create an index for SSTables that stores only some keys and their disk locations.
   - Speeds up binary search by reducing the search range.
   - Example:
     ```
     Sparse Index:
     Adam → Disk Location 1
     Jordan → Disk Location 2
     Sam → Disk Location 3
     ```
2. **Bloom Filters**:
   - A probabilistic data structure that quickly checks if a key **might** be in an SSTable.
   - Reduces unnecessary disk reads by skipping SSTables that definitely don’t contain the key.

---

#### **7. Compaction**
- **Problem**: Over time, SSTables accumulate duplicate and deleted keys, wasting disk space.
- **Solution**: **Compaction** merges SSTables, removing duplicates and tombstones.
- **Process**:
  1. Merge two SSTables into a new, sorted SSTable.
  2. Keep the most recent value for each key.
  3. Discard tombstones for deleted keys.
- **Example**:
  - SSTable 1: [Alex:91, Bob:90]
  - SSTable 2: [Alex:93, Dan:92]
  - Merged SSTable: [Alex:93, Bob:90, Dan:92]

#### **8. Performance of LSM Trees**
- **Writes**:
  - Fast (O(log n)) because they go to the in-memory tree.
  - Slowed slightly by the WAL and periodic flushing to SSTables.
- **Reads**:
  - O(log n) for the in-memory tree.
  - O(log n) for binary search on SSTables.
  - Slower than hash indexes but faster than B-Trees for large datasets.
- **Range Queries**:
  - Supported due to sorted SSTables.
  - Slower than B-Trees because multiple SSTables must be searched.

#### **9. Comparison of Indexes**
| **Aspect**         | **Hash Index**                     | **B-Tree**                        | **LSM Tree**                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Storage**         | In memory                          | On disk                           | In memory + on disk (SSTables)    |
| **Range Queries**   | Not supported                      | Supported (efficient)             | Supported (slower than B-Trees)   |
| **Scalability**     | Limited by memory size             | Handles large datasets            | Handles large datasets            |
| **Read Speed**      | O(1)                               | O(log n)                          | O(log n)                          |
| **Write Speed**     | O(1)                               | Slower (disk writes)              | Fast (in-memory tree)             |
| **Durability**      | Requires WAL                       | Built-in durability               | Uses WAL for durability           |
