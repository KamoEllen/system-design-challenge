#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Write Skew and Phantoms, two types of race conditions that can occur in databases during concurrent transactions.
- **Goal**: Understand what write skew and phantoms are, how they occur, and how to prevent them.

---

#### **2. Write Skew**
- **Definition**: A race condition where two transactions modify different rows, but their combined changes violate a database invariant.
- **Example**:
  - **Scenario**: An emergency room database tracks active doctors. The invariant is that **at least one doctor must be active** at all times.
  - **Transaction 1 (T1)**: Dr. Oz sets himself to inactive.
  - **Transaction 2 (T2)**: Dr. Toboggan sets himself to inactive.
  - **Result**: Both doctors are inactive, violating the invariant.

---

#### **3. Why Write Skew Happens**
- **Cause**: Transactions modify different rows without considering the impact on the overall invariant.
- **Problem**: Row-level locks only prevent concurrent writes to the **same row**, not related rows.

---

#### **4. Preventing Write Skew**
- **Solution**: Use **predicate locks** or **lock all relevant rows**.
  - **Predicate Locks**: Lock all rows that match a condition (e.g., `WHERE status = 'active'`).
  - **Lock All Relevant Rows**: Before modifying a row, lock all rows that affect the invariant.
  - **Example**:
    - Before setting Dr. Oz to inactive, lock all active doctors (e.g., Dr. Toboggan).
    - If Dr. Toboggan is also trying to set himself to inactive, one transaction will block until the other completes.

---

#### **5. Phantoms**
- **Definition**: A race condition where two transactions insert new rows that conflict with each other, violating a database invariant.
- **Example**:
  - **Scenario**: A bakery database tracks orders for cookies, pie, and cupcakes. The invariant is that **only one person can claim an item**.
  - **Transaction 1 (T1)**: Jordan claims the last cupcake.
  - **Transaction 2 (T2)**: Donald claims the last cupcake.
  - **Result**: Both transactions insert a new row for the cupcake, violating the invariant.

---

#### **6. Why Phantoms Happen**
- **Cause**: New rows do not exist when transactions start, so there are no locks to prevent conflicts.
- **Problem**: Traditional row-level locks cannot prevent concurrent inserts of new rows.

---

#### **7. Preventing Phantoms**
- **Solution**: Use **materialized conflicts**.
  - **Materialized Conflicts**: Pre-populate the database with rows for all possible items (e.g., cookies, pie, cupcakes) and lock them before inserting new rows.
  - **Example**:
    - Pre-populate the bakery database with rows for cookies, pie, and cupcakes.
    - Before claiming an item, lock the corresponding row.
    - If Jordan locks the cupcake row, Donald must wait until the lock is released.

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Write Skew**:
  - Occurs when transactions modify different rows, violating a database invariant.
  - Prevented by locking all relevant rows or using predicate locks.
- **Phantoms**:
  - Occurs when transactions insert new rows that conflict with each other.
  - Prevented by materializing conflicts (pre-populating rows and locking them).
