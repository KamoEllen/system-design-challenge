#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Distributed Consensus using the Raft Algorithm.
- **Goal**: Understand how Raft ensures linearizable storage through leader election and log replication.

---

#### **2. What is Raft?**
- **Definition**: A distributed consensus algorithm designed to manage a replicated log across multiple nodes.
- **Purpose**: Ensures linearizable storage, which is critical for applications like distributed locks and service discovery.
- **Key Idea**: Uses a leader-follower model to replicate a log of operations across nodes.

#### **3. Why Raft?**
- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and implement compared to other consensus algorithms like Paxos.
- **Linearizability**: Ensures that all operations appear to occur in a single, globally consistent order.

#### **4. Raft Leader Election**
- **Leader Role**: The leader is responsible for replicating the log to followers.
- **Heartbeats**: The leader sends periodic heartbeats to followers to maintain its authority.
- **Failure Detection**: If a follower stops receiving heartbeats, it assumes the leader has failed and initiates an election.

#### **5. How Leader Election Works**
1. **Candidate Proposal**:
   - A follower becomes a candidate and proposes a new term (epoch number).
   - Example: A follower proposes term 29 after the previous leader (term 28) fails.
2. **Voting**:
   - The candidate sends a request to all followers, asking for their vote.
   - Followers respond based on:
     - **Term Number**: If the candidate’s term is higher, the follower updates its term and may vote "yes."
     - **Log Completeness**: The follower checks if the candidate’s log is at least as up-to-date as its own.
3. **Quorum Requirement**:
   - The candidate needs a majority (quorum) of votes to become the leader.
   - Example: In a 3-node cluster, the candidate needs 2 votes.

#### **6. Why Leader Election Works**
1. **Single Leader**:
   - Only one leader can be elected per term due to the quorum requirement.
   - Overlapping quorums prevent multiple leaders from being elected simultaneously.
2. **Fencing Tokens**:
   - Each term acts as a fencing token, ensuring that old leaders cannot interfere with the current leader’s operations.
   - Example: A leader with term 28 cannot propose writes if a new leader with term 29 is elected.
3. **Log Consistency**:
   - The leader’s log is always at least as up-to-date as a majority of nodes.
   - This ensures that stale nodes can be brought up-to-date by the leader.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **Raft Leader Election**:
  - Ensures a single leader is elected per term.
  - Uses term numbers and log completeness to determine eligibility.
- **Quorum Requirement**:
  - A majority of nodes must agree for a leader to be elected.
- **Fencing Tokens**:
  - Prevent old leaders from interfering with the current leader’s operations.

---

#### **8. Conclusion**
- Raft’s leader election mechanism ensures that only one leader exists at a time, maintaining consistency across the distributed system.
- In the next video, we’ll explore how the leader replicates the log to followers, ensuring linearizable storage.
