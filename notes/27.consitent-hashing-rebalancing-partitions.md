#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Consistent Hashing and Partitioning Strategies in Distributed Systems.
- **Goal**: Understand how consistent hashing works, its benefits, and alternative partitioning strategies.

---

#### **2. The Problem with Modulus-Based Partitioning**
- **Naive Approach**: Use `hash(key) % n` to distribute keys across `n` nodes.
- **Issue**: When nodes are added or removed, most keys need to be rehashed and moved, causing significant network overhead.
- **Example**:
  - Initial setup: 4 nodes, keys distributed using `hash(key) % 4`.
  - Remove node 3: Now use `hash(key) % 3`, causing most keys to move to new nodes.

#### **3. What is Consistent Hashing?**
- **Definition**: A partitioning strategy that minimizes data movement when nodes are added or removed.
- **Key Idea**: Distribute keys evenly across nodes using a hash ring, ensuring only a small fraction of keys need to be rebalanced during cluster changes.

---

#### **4. How Consistent Hashing Works**
- **Hash Ring**:
  - A circular space representing the hash range (e.g., 0 to 1000).
  - Nodes and keys are mapped to points on the ring using a hash function.
- **Key Assignment**:
  - Each key is assigned to the next node in the clockwise direction on the ring.
  - Each node is assigned multiple points (`k` points) on the ring to ensure even distribution.
- **Example**:
  - Node 3 has points at 0-100, 200-250, and 700-800 on the ring.
  - Keys in these ranges are assigned to Node 3.

#### **5. Benefits of Consistent Hashing**
1. **Minimal Rebalancing**:
   - When a node is added or removed, only the keys adjacent to the affected node need to be moved.
   - Example:
     - Remove Node 4: Keys previously assigned to Node 4 are redistributed to neighboring nodes.
     - Add Node 4: Only a small subset of keys from neighboring nodes are moved to Node 4.
2. **Even Distribution**:
   - Keys are evenly distributed across nodes, reducing hotspots.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Adding or removing nodes does not require rehashing all keys.

#### **6. Fixed Number of Partitions**
- **Definition**: A partitioning strategy where the total number of partitions is fixed across the system.
- **How It Works**:
  - Each node is assigned a subset of partitions.
  - When a node is added or removed, partitions are redistributed among the remaining nodes.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple to implement and manage.
- **Cons**:
  - Choosing the wrong number of partitions can lead to inefficiencies:
    - Too few partitions: Each partition becomes too large to fit on a single node.
    - Too many partitions: Increased overhead for managing partition metadata.

---

#### **7. Dynamic Partitioning**
- **Definition**: A strategy where the system automatically rebalances partitions based on load or node availability.
- **Pros**:
  - Reduces manual intervention.
  - Adapts to changes in workload or cluster size.
- **Cons**:
  - Risk of unnecessary rebalancing if the system misinterprets node failures or load changes.
  - Increased network overhead if rebalancing is triggered too frequently.

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Consistent Hashing**:
  - Minimizes data movement during cluster changes.
  - Ensures even distribution of keys across nodes.
- **Fixed Partitions**:
  - Simple but requires careful selection of the number of partitions.
- **Dynamic Partitioning**:
  - Automates rebalancing but risks unnecessary overhead.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
- Consistent hashing is a powerful tool for minimizing rebalancing overhead in distributed systems.
- Fixed partitions and dynamic partitioning offer alternative strategies, each with its own trade-offs.
- In the next video, weâ€™ll explore **distributed consensus** to address challenges like node failure detection and agreement in distributed systems.
