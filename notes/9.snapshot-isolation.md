#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Read Skew and Snapshot Isolation, two concepts that address consistency issues in databases during concurrent transactions.
- **Goal**: Understand how **read skew** occurs and how **snapshot isolation** can prevent it.

---

#### **2. What is Read Skew?**
- **Definition**: A race condition where a long-running read operation sees inconsistent data due to concurrent writes.
- **Example**:
  - A database table tracks the Kardashians' bank accounts, with a total balance of $1 million.
  - A query reads each account balance sequentially:
    1. Reads Caitlyn: $100K
    2. Reads Kylie: $200K
    3. Reads Kendall: $300K
    4. Reads Chloe: $200K
    5. Reads Courtney: $100K
  - Midway through the read, Caitlyn receives $100K from Chris (her balance updates to $200K, Chris's balance drops to $0).
  - The query reads Chris: $0.
  - **Result**: The total balance appears as $900K instead of $1 million, violating the database invariant.

---

#### **3. Why Read Skew Happens**
- **Cause**: Long-running reads interleave with concurrent writes, leading to inconsistent snapshots of the database.
- **Impact**: Breaks database invariants (e.g., total balance must always sum to $1 million).

---

#### **4. Snapshot Isolation**
- **Definition**: A database isolation level that ensures a transaction sees a **consistent snapshot** of the database as of the start of the transaction.
- **How It Works**:
  1. Each transaction is assigned a **monotonically increasing sequence number** (e.g., T1, T2, T3).
  2. When a transaction starts, it captures the current sequence number.
  3. The transaction only sees data committed **before its sequence number**.
  4. Writes by other transactions that occur after the snapshot are ignored.

---

#### **5. Implementing Snapshot Isolation**
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**:
  - Every write is logged with a sequence number.
  - Old values are retained instead of being overwritten.
  - Example:
    - Caitlyn's balance:
      - T1: $100K
      - T6: $300K
      - T12: $200K
    - If a transaction starts at T15, it sees Caitlyn's balance as $200K (the most recent value before T15).
- **Database Snapshot**:
  - For a transaction starting at T15:
    - Caitlyn: $200K (T12)
    - Kendall: $1M (T15)
    - Chris: Does not exist (first written at T22)
    - Lamar: $100K (T3)

---

#### **6. Benefits of Snapshot Isolation**
- **Consistency**: Ensures long-running reads see a consistent state of the database.
- **Performance**: Avoids locking, allowing concurrent reads and writes.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement using a write-ahead log and sequence numbers.

---

#### **7. Trade-Offs**
- **Storage Overhead**: Retaining old values increases storage requirements.
- **Complexity**: Requires careful management of sequence numbers and snapshots.

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Read Skew**:
  - Occurs when long-running reads interleave with concurrent writes, leading to inconsistent data.
  - Breaks database invariants.
- **Snapshot Isolation**:
  - Ensures transactions see a consistent snapshot of the database.
  - Uses a write-ahead log and sequence numbers to track changes.
  - Prevents read skew without locking.
