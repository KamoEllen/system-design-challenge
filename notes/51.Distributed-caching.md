#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Caching, a technique used to improve the performance of distributed systems by storing frequently accessed data in faster storage.
- **Goal**: Understand the benefits, drawbacks, and implementation strategies of caching in distributed systems.

---

#### **2. What is Caching?**
- **Definition**: Storing copies of data in faster storage (e.g., memory) to reduce access time and computational load.
- **Analogy**: Similar to CPU caches (L1, L2, L3) that store frequently accessed data to reduce latency compared to slower main memory or disk.

---

#### **3. Benefits of Caching**
1. **Faster Reads and Writes**:
   - Caches use faster storage (e.g., RAM) compared to disks.
   - Example: Reading from memory is significantly faster than reading from a database on disk.
2. **Reduced Network Calls**:
   - Caches can be placed closer to clients or on application servers, reducing the need for repeated database queries.
3. **Load Reduction on Critical Components**:
   - Caches absorb repetitive requests, reducing the load on databases and other backend systems.
   - Example: Caching a user’s home feed on a social media platform to avoid repeated database queries.

---

#### **4. Disadvantages of Caching**
1. **Cache Misses**:
   - If data is not found in the cache, the system must fetch it from the slower backend, increasing latency.
   - Example: A cache miss requires a network call to the database, adding overhead.
2. **Data Consistency Issues**:
   - Caches can become stale if not properly synchronized with the backend.
   - Example: A user updates their password, but the cache still serves the old password, causing login failures.
3. **Complexity**:
   - Managing cache invalidation, eviction policies, and consistency adds complexity to the system.

#### **5. What Can We Cache?**
1. **Database Results**:
   - Frequently queried data (e.g., user profiles, product details).
2. **Computation Results**:
   - Results of expensive computations (e.g., aggregations, joins).
3. **Static Content**:
   - Images, CSS files, JavaScript files, and other static assets (often cached using CDNs).

---

#### **6. Server-Local Caching**
- **Definition**: Storing cached data directly on the application server.
- **Example**: A user’s Tinder likes are cached on the application server to avoid repeated database queries.
- **Pros**:
  - Fewer network calls, as the cache is local to the server.
  - Faster access to cached data.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited cache storage based on the number of application servers.
  - Cache data is lost if the server goes down.
  - Requires **consistent hashing** to ensure the same client always hits the same server.

---

#### **7. Global Caching Layer**
- **Definition**: A centralized cache shared across multiple application servers.
- **Example**: A Redis cluster used as a global cache for all application servers.
- **Pros**:
  - Scalable independently of application servers.
  - Centralized management of cached data.
- **Cons**:
  - Additional network call to access the cache.
  - Increased system complexity and potential failure points.

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Caching**:
  - Improves performance by reducing latency and load on backend systems.
  - Can store database results, computation results, and static content.
- **Server-Local Caching**:
  - Faster access but limited by server resources.
  - Requires consistent hashing for cache hits.
- **Global Caching**:
  - Scalable but introduces additional network latency and complexity.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Cache misses and data consistency are major challenges.
  - Proper cache invalidation and eviction policies are crucial.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
- **Caching** is a powerful tool for optimizing distributed systems, but it comes with trade-offs like cache misses and data consistency issues.
- **Server-local caching** is ideal for reducing network calls, while **global caching** offers scalability.
- In the next videos, we’ll dive deeper into **cache write strategies** and **eviction policies** to address these challenges.
