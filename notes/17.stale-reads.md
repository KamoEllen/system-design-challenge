#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Eventual Consistency and strategies to mitigate its challenges.
- **Goal**: Understand the issues with eventual consistency and learn techniques to improve the user experience in eventually consistent systems.

#### **2. What is Eventual Consistency?**
- **Definition**: A consistency model where updates to a database are propagated to all replicas over time, but there is no guarantee of immediate consistency.
- **Trade-Off**: Sacrifices strong consistency for improved performance and scalability.
- **Problem**: Users may read stale data, leading to a poor experience.

#### **3. Challenges of Eventual Consistency**
1. **Stale Reads**:
   - Users may not see their own writes immediately.
   - Example: Updating a relationship status on Facebook but still seeing "Single" when reading from a stale replica.
2. **Monotonic Reads**:
   - Users may see data moving "backward in time" if they read from different replicas.
   - Example: In a group chat, messages appear out of order because different replicas are at different states.
3. **Consistent Prefixes**:
   - Users may see causally related events out of order.
   - Example: In a chat, a reply ("Sure") appears before the original message ("Want to grab lunch?").

#### **4. Techniques to Improve Eventual Consistency**
1. **Reading Your Own Writes**:
   - **Problem**: Users may not see their own writes immediately after making them.
   - **Solution**:
     - For a short period after a write (e.g., 10 seconds), direct the user to read from the same database they wrote to.
     - Alternatively, use timestamps to ensure replicas have received the write before allowing reads.
   - **Example**: After updating a relationship status, ensure the user reads from the primary database for a short time to see the update.

2. **Monotonic Reads**:
   - **Problem**: Users may see data moving "backward in time" if they read from different replicas.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure users always read from the same replica.
     - Use a consistent hashing mechanism (e.g., `user_id % number_of_replicas`) to assign users to specific replicas.
   - **Example**: In a group chat, ensure a user always reads from the same replica to avoid seeing messages out of order.

3. **Consistent Prefixes**:
   - **Problem**: Users may see causally related events out of order.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure causally related writes go to the same partition or replica.
     - Use application logic (e.g., a "Reply" button) to enforce causal dependencies.
   - **Example**: In a chat, ensure replies are stored in the same partition as the original message to maintain order.

#### **5. Key Takeaways**
- **Eventual Consistency**:
  - Improves performance and scalability but introduces the risk of stale reads.
  - Common in distributed systems where strong consistency is too costly.
- **Techniques to Improve User Experience**:
  - **Reading Your Own Writes**: Direct users to read from the primary database for a short time after a write.
  - **Monotonic Reads**: Ensure users always read from the same replica to avoid seeing data move backward in time.
  - **Consistent Prefixes**: Ensure causally related writes are stored in the same partition or replica.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - These techniques add complexity but significantly improve the user experience in eventually consistent systems.

#### **6. Summary**
- Eventual consistency is a common trade-off in distributed systems, but it can lead to stale reads and a poor user experience.
- By implementing techniques like **reading your own writes**, **monotonic reads**, and **consistent prefixes**, we can mitigate the most glaring issues and provide a smoother experience for users.
- These strategies are essential for building scalable and performant systems while maintaining a reasonable level of consistency.
