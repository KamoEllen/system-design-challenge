#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: NewSQL Databases and VoltDB.
- **Goal**: Understand how VoltDB improves transaction performance and the trade-offs involved.

---

#### **2. What is NewSQL?**
- **Definition**: A class of databases that combine the relational model of SQL databases with the scalability and performance improvements of NoSQL databases.
- **Key Idea**: NewSQL databases aim to address the limitations of traditional SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) while maintaining ACID compliance.
- **Examples**: VoltDB, Google Spanner.

#### **3. VoltDB Overview**
- **Core Idea**: **Serial execution** of transactions on a single CPU thread.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Transactions are queued and executed one at a time on a single thread.
    - Avoids the overhead of locking, multi-threading, and rollbacks.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Simplifies concurrency control.
    - Ensures strict transaction ordering.
  - **Disadvantages**:
    - CPU becomes the bottleneck.
    - Requires extremely fast transaction execution to maintain performance.

#### **4. Bottlenecks in Traditional Databases**
1. **Disk I/O**:
   - Traditional SQL databases write data to disk, which is slow due to the mechanical nature of hard drives.
   - **Solution in VoltDB**: Store all data **in memory**.
     - **Advantages**:
       - Faster reads and writes (O(1) with hash indexes).
       - Eliminates disk I/O overhead.
     - **Disadvantages**:
       - Memory is expensive, limiting dataset size.
       - Requires more partitions for large datasets, increasing the need for distributed transactions.
2. **Network Latency**:
   - Multiple round trips between the client and database slow down transactions.
   - **Solution in VoltDB**: Use **stored procedures**.
     - **How It Works**:
       - Send the entire transaction logic to the database in one round trip.
       - The database executes the logic locally, reducing network overhead.
     - **Advantages**:
       - Reduces network latency.
       - Improves transaction throughput.
     - **Disadvantages**:
       - Stored procedures are harder to manage and debug.
       - Less flexibility compared to application-level logic.

#### **5. Trade-offs in VoltDB**
1. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Extremely fast reads and writes.
     - No disk I/O bottlenecks.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited by memory size, requiring more partitions.
     - Distributed transactions (e.g., two-phase commit) are slow and frequent.
2. **Serial Execution**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Simplifies concurrency control.
     - Ensures strict transaction ordering.
   - **Cons**:
     - CPU becomes the bottleneck.
     - Requires extremely fast transaction execution.
3. **Stored Procedures**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Reduces network latency.
     - Improves transaction throughput.
   - **Cons**:
     - Harder to manage and debug.
     - Less flexibility compared to application-level logic.

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **VoltDB**:
  - Uses **in-memory storage** and **serial execution** to achieve high transaction throughput.
  - Eliminates disk I/O and reduces network latency using **stored procedures**.
  - Trade-offs include limited memory size, frequent distributed transactions, and reduced flexibility.
- **NewSQL**:
  - Combines the relational model of SQL with the scalability of NoSQL.
  - Ideal for applications requiring **ACID compliance** and **high performance**.
- **Use Cases**:
  - VoltDB is best suited for applications with **high transaction rates** and **small to medium datasets**.
  - Not ideal for large datasets requiring frequent cross-partition transactions.
