#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: HBase, a database built on top of Hadoop.
- **Goal**: Understand HBase's architecture, use cases, and how it improves upon Hadoop's limitations.

---

#### **2. Recap: Hadoop and HDFS**
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**:
  - A distributed file system for storing large datasets.
  - **Limitation**: Modifying files requires overwriting the entire file, which is inefficient for frequent updates.
- **Problem**: HDFS is not optimized for **ad-hoc updates** or **real-time modifications**.

---

#### **3. What is HBase?**
- **Definition**: A **NoSQL database** built on top of Hadoop, designed for **real-time read/write access** to large datasets.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **LSM Trees**: Enables efficient in-memory writes and batch updates to disk.
  2. **Column-Oriented Storage**: Optimized for analytical queries and batch processing.
  3. **Range-Based Partitioning**: Keeps related data (e.g., similar keys) on the same node for better data locality.

---

#### **4. HBase Data Model**
- **Wide-Column Store**:
  - Similar to Cassandra, but optimized for different use cases.
  - **Row Key**: Determines partitioning and ordering of data.
  - **Columns**: Flexible schema with optional columns.
- **Range-Based Partitioning**:
  - Data is partitioned based on the **row key range**.
  - Ensures related data is stored together, improving query performance.

#### **5. HBase Architecture**
1. **Master Node**:
   - Similar to Hadoop's **Name Node**.
   - Manages metadata (e.g., file locations, versions).
   - Directs clients to the appropriate **Region Node** for writes.
2. **Region Node**:
   - Handles **LSM Trees** for in-memory writes.
   - Flushes data to **SSTables** on disk when the LSM tree grows too large.
3. **Data Node**:
   - Part of Hadoop's HDFS.
   - Stores **SSTables** and replicates them across the cluster using Hadoop's **replication pipeline**.
4. **High Availability**:
   - Uses **Zookeeper** for distributed consensus.
   - A **secondary Master Node** can take over if the primary fails.

---

#### **6. LSM Trees in HBase**
- **LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)**:
  - **In-Memory Tree**: Writes are first stored in an in-memory binary search tree.
  - **SSTables**: When the tree grows too large, it is flushed to disk as a sorted SSTable.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Efficient for **write-heavy workloads**.
    - Minimizes disk I/O by batching writes.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**:
  - Ensures data durability by logging writes before they are applied to the LSM tree.

---

#### **7. Column-Oriented Storage**
- **Definition**: Data is stored by columns rather than rows.
- **Advantages**:
  1. **Analytical Queries**: Faster aggregation and filtering (e.g., calculating averages).
  2. **Data Locality**: Related data is stored together, reducing network overhead.
  3. **Compression**: Column values are often similar, enabling efficient compression.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for **batch processing** and **analytics**.

---

#### **8. Range-Based Partitioning**
- **Definition**: Data is partitioned based on the **row key range**.
- **Advantages**:
  1. **Data Locality**: Related data (e.g., timestamps) is stored on the same node.
  2. **Efficient Queries**: Reduces network traffic for range-based queries.
- **Example**: Calculating a trailing average of sensor data over time.

---

#### **9. Key Takeaways**
- **HBase**:
  - Built on Hadoop for **real-time read/write access** to large datasets.
  - Uses **LSM Trees** for efficient writes and **column-oriented storage** for analytics.
  - Optimized for **batch processing** and **range-based queries**.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Sensor Data**: Frequent updates and batch processing.
  - **Time-Series Data**: Efficient range queries and aggregations.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Not ideal for **client-facing applications** with simple read/write patterns (use Cassandra instead).
  - Requires Hadoop infrastructure, which can be complex to manage.

---

#### **10. Conclusion**
- **HBase** is a powerful database for **real-time updates** and **batch processing** on large datasets.
- It improves upon Hadoop's limitations by enabling **efficient modifications** and **analytical queries**.
- In the next video, weâ€™ll explore **batch processing frameworks** like MapReduce and Spark.
