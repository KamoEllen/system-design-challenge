#### **1. Hard Drive Mechanics**
- **Structure**:
  - **Metallic Disc**: Data is stored on a spinning metallic disc.
  - **Moving Arm**: A mechanical arm reads/writes data by moving to specific locations on the disc.
- **Performance Consideration**:
  - **Data Locality**: The closer data is stored on the disc, the faster it can be accessed.
  - **Example**: If two pieces of data are stored next to each other, the arm can access them quickly without moving far.

#### **2. Database Table Example**
- **Scenario**: A website stores names and shoe sizes of users.
- **Table Structure**:
  - **Rows**: Each row represents a user with their name and shoe size.
  - **Example Table**:
    | Name          | Shoe Size |
    |---------------|-----------|
    | Jordan        | 18        |
    | Donald Trump  | 7         |
    | Shaquille O'Neal | 24      |

---

#### **3. Time Complexity of Database Operations**
- **Read Operation**:
  - **Task**: Find a row where the name is "Jordan."
  - **Process**: Scan each row one by one until the target row is found.
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of rows.
- **Write Operation**:
  - **Task**: Update Shaquille O'Neal’s shoe size from 24 to 26.
  - **Process**: 
    1. Find the row by scanning all rows (O(n)).
    2. Update the shoe size.
  - **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** for both finding and updating the row.

---

#### **4. Optimizing Write Operations**
- **Append-Only Approach**:
  - **Idea**: Instead of updating existing rows, append new rows with updated data.
  - **Example**:
    - Original Table:
      | Name          | Shoe Size |
      |---------------|-----------|
      | Donald Trump  | 7         |
    - Updated Table (Append New Row):
      | Name          | Shoe Size |
      |---------------|-----------|
      | Donald Trump  | 7         |
      | Donald Trump  | 6         |
  - **Read Process**: Always read the latest row (bottom-up).
  - **Write Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (appending to the end of the table).
  - **Trade-Off**: 
    - **Read Time Complexity**: Still **O(n)**, but `n` increases due to duplicate rows.

---

#### **5. The Need for Indexes**
- **Problem**: Linear scans (O(n)) are too slow for large datasets (e.g., millions of rows).
- **Solution**: Use **indexes** to speed up read operations.
- **What is an Index?**:
  - A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval.
  - **Trade-Off**: Improves read speeds but may slow down write speeds.

---

#### **6. Common Database Queries**
- **Key-Based Queries**:
  - **Example**: Find rows where the name is "Jordan."
  - **Use Case**: Common in social media platforms (e.g., fetching a user’s profile).
- **Range Queries**:
  - **Example**: Find rows with names between "A" and "B."
  - **Use Case**: Fetching posts from a specific time range (e.g., last hour).

---

#### **7. Database Indexes**
- **Purpose**: Improve read speeds for specific queries.
- **How It Works**:
  - Creates a separate data structure (e.g., hash table, B-tree) to map keys to rows.
  - Allows faster lookups than scanning the entire table.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Read Speeds**: Improved (e.g., O(log n) or O(1) depending on the index type).
  - **Write Speeds**: Slower due to maintaining the index.

---

#### **8. Types of Indexes**
- **Single-Column Index**: Index on one field (e.g., name).
- **Multi-Column Index**: Index on multiple fields (e.g., name and shoe size).
- **Example**: A hash index (to be covered in the next lecture).

---

#### **9. Key Takeaways**
- **Hard Drive Mechanics**: Data locality affects performance; closer data is faster to access.
- **Database Operations**:
  - **Reads**: O(n) without indexes.
  - **Writes**: Can be optimized to O(1) using append-only approach.
- **Indexes**: Improve read speeds at the cost of slower writes.
- **Common Queries**: Key-based and range queries are frequent in real-world applications.
