#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Read Committed Isolation, a database isolation level that prevents **dirty reads** and **dirty writes**.
- **Goal**: Understand how Read Committed Isolation works, its benefits, and how it handles race conditions.

---

#### **2. Concurrency in Databases**
- **Challenge**: Databases are **multi-threaded**, meaning multiple transactions (reads and writes) can occur simultaneously.
- **Problem**: Without proper isolation, concurrent transactions can lead to **race conditions**, causing incorrect or inconsistent results.

---

#### **3. What is Read Committed Isolation?**
- **Definition**: A database isolation level that ensures:
  1. **No Dirty Reads**: A transaction cannot read uncommitted data from another transaction.
  2. **No Dirty Writes**: A transaction cannot overwrite uncommitted data from another transaction.
- **Key Idea**: Transactions only interact with **committed data**.

---

#### **4. Dirty Writes**
- **Definition**: When one transaction overwrites uncommitted data from another transaction.
- **Example**:
  - **Transaction 1 (T1)**: Writes "Jordan" to `bathwater.purchaser`.
  - **Transaction 2 (T2)**: Writes "Donald" to `bathwater.purchaser` before T1 commits.
  - **Result**: Inconsistent data (e.g., `bathwater.purchaser` is "Donald" but `delivery.address` is "Your Mom's House").
- **Solution**: Use **row-level locks** to prevent concurrent writes to the same row.
  - **How It Works**:
    1. T1 locks the row for writing.
    2. T2 must wait until T1 releases the lock.
    3. Ensures only one transaction can write to a row at a time.

---

#### **5. Dirty Reads**
- **Definition**: When a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction.
- **Example**:
  - **Transaction 1 (T1)**: Deducts $10 from Jordan's account.
  - **Transaction 2 (T2)**: Reads Jordan's balance before T1 commits.
  - **Result**: T2 sees an incorrect balance (e.g., $90 instead of $100).
- **Solution**: Use **versioning** or **locking** to prevent reading uncommitted data.
  - **Versioning**:
    1. Store both the **old value** and **new value** during a write.
    2. Readers access the **old value** until the transaction commits.
    3. After commit, switch to the **new value**.
  - **Locking**:
    1. T1 locks the row for writing.
    2. T2 must wait until T1 releases the lock before reading.

---

#### **6. Benefits of Read Committed Isolation**
- **Consistency**: Ensures transactions only interact with committed data.
- **Performance**: Avoids the overhead of stricter isolation levels (e.g., Serializable).
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement than higher isolation levels.

---

#### **7. Trade-Offs**
- **Performance**:
  - **Locking**: Can cause bottlenecks if many transactions try to access the same row.
  - **Versioning**: Requires additional storage for old and new values.
- **Isolation Level**:
  - **Read Committed** prevents dirty reads and dirty writes but does not prevent other race conditions (e.g., non-repeatable reads, phantom reads).

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Read Committed Isolation**:
  - Prevents **dirty reads** and **dirty writes**.
  - Ensures transactions only interact with **committed data**.
- **Solutions**:
  - **Row-Level Locking**: Prevents dirty writes.
  - **Versioning**: Prevents dirty reads without locking.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Balances consistency and performance.
  - Does not prevent all race conditions (e.g., non-repeatable reads).
