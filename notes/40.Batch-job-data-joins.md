#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Performing Joins in Batch Jobs.
- **Goal**: Understand different types of joins (Sort-Merge Join, Broadcast Hash Join, Partitioned Hash Join) and their performance implications in distributed systems.

---

#### **2. Why Joins in Batch Jobs?**
- **Use Case**: Combining multiple datasets (e.g., SQL-like joins) during batch processing.
- **Challenge**: Optimizing joins to minimize network and disk I/O overhead.
- **Example**: Joining a dataset of user demographics with a dataset of user website visits.

#### **3. Types of Joins**
1. **Sort-Merge Join**:
   - **How It Works**:
     - **Step 1**: Sort both datasets by the join key.
     - **Step 2**: Merge the sorted datasets using a linear scan.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Works for any dataset size.
     - Can be performed entirely on disk (no memory constraints).
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Sorting is expensive (O(n log n) for large datasets.
     - Requires repartitioning at least one dataset, leading to network overhead.
   - **Use Case**: General-purpose join for large datasets.

2. **Broadcast Hash Join**:
   - **How It Works**:
     - **Step 1**: Broadcast the smaller dataset to all nodes.
     - **Step 2**: Load the smaller dataset into memory as a hash map.
     - **Step 3**: Scan the larger dataset and perform lookups in the hash map.
   - **Advantages**:
     - No sorting required for the larger dataset.
     - Efficient for small datasets that fit in memory.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires the smaller dataset to fit in memory on all nodes.
   - **Use Case**: Joining a small dataset with a large dataset.

3. **Partitioned Hash Join**:
   - **How It Works**:
     - **Step 1**: Partition both datasets by the join key.
     - **Step 2**: Send corresponding partitions to the same node.
     - **Step 3**: Perform a hash join on each partition.
   - **Advantages**:
     - No sorting required for the larger dataset.
     - Minimizes network overhead by only sending relevant partitions.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires both datasets to be partitioned by the same key.
   - **Use Case**: Joining two large datasets that are already partitioned by the same key.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Sort-Merge Join**:
  - General-purpose but expensive due to sorting and network overhead.
  - Best for large datasets where neither dataset fits in memory.
- **Broadcast Hash Join**:
  - Efficient for small datasets that fit in memory.
  - Avoids sorting and minimizes disk I/O for the larger dataset.
- **Partitioned Hash Join**:
  - Efficient for large datasets that are already partitioned by the same key.
  - Avoids sorting and reduces network overhead.

#### **5. Optimizing Joins**
- **Pre-Partitioning and Indexing**:
  - Partition and index datasets by the same key to enable efficient joins.
  - Avoids the need for sorting and reduces network overhead.
- **Choosing the Right Join**:
  - Use **Broadcast Hash Join** for small datasets.
  - Use **Partitioned Hash Join** for large datasets with matching partitions.
  - Use **Sort-Merge Join** as a fallback for general-purpose joins.
