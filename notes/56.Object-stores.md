#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Object Stores and Data Lakes, solutions for storing and managing large volumes of static content.
- **Goal**: Understand the role of object stores in modern systems, their advantages, and how they compare to traditional solutions like Hadoop.

#### **2. The Problem with CDNs**
- **CDNs** are great for caching static content (e.g., images, videos) but have limited storage capacity.
- **Challenge**: Where to store the **source of truth** for static content that doesnâ€™t fit in CDNs?
- **Traditional Solution**: **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**.
  - **Pros**: Combines storage and compute for large-scale batch processing.
  - **Cons**: Expensive, complex to manage, and inefficient for pure storage needs.

#### **3. What are Object Stores?**
- **Definition**: Scalable, cost-effective storage systems designed for unstructured data (e.g., logs, images, videos).
- **Examples**:
  - **Amazon S3**.
  - **Google Cloud Storage**.
  - **Azure Blob Storage**.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjusts storage capacity as needed.
  2. **Replication**: Handles data replication and fault tolerance.
  3. **Cost-Effective**: Much cheaper than running a Hadoop cluster (e.g., 1/10th the cost).
  4. **Ease of Use**: No need to manage hardware or estimate storage needs.

#### **4. Data Lakes**
- **Definition**: A centralized repository for storing raw, unstructured data (e.g., logs, metrics, images).
- **Key Idea**: Store data in its raw form and process it later as needed.
- **Comparison to Data Warehouses**:
  - **Data Warehouse**: Structured, schema-based storage for analytics (e.g., SQL tables).
  - **Data Lake**: Schema-less storage for raw data, ideal for diverse and unstructured data.
- **Use Case**: Companies with large volumes of data from multiple sources (e.g., logs, user-generated content).

---

#### **5. Batch Jobs on Object Stores**
- **Challenge**: Object stores are optimized for storage, not compute.
- **Solution**:
  1. **Export Data**: Move data from the object store (e.g., S3) to a distributed computing cluster (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
  2. **Run Batch Jobs**: Process the data on the cluster.
- **Trade-Off**:
  - **Pros**: Cost-effective storage with scalable compute when needed.
  - **Cons**: Data transfer over the network can be slow.

---

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Object Stores**:
  - Ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., logs, images, videos).
  - Cost-effective and easy to manage compared to Hadoop.
- **Data Lakes**:
  - Centralized repositories for raw, unstructured data.
  - Enable flexible data processing and analytics.
- **Batch Jobs**:
  - Export data from object stores to distributed computing clusters for processing.
  - Slower due to network transfer but cost-effective.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- **Object Stores** like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for storing static content.
- **Data Lakes** build on object stores, offering a centralized repository for raw data.
- While object stores are not ideal for running batch jobs directly, they complement distributed computing systems like Hadoop and Spark for large-scale data processing.
- The trade-off between cost and performance makes object stores a popular choice for modern data storage needs.
