#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Leaderless replication and quorums in distributed systems.
- **Goal**: Understand how quorums work, their limitations, and why they don’t guarantee strong consistency.

---

#### **2. Recap: Leaderless Replication**
- **Definition**: A replication strategy where writes are sent to multiple nodes, and reads are performed from multiple nodes without a single leader.
- **Key Mechanisms**:
  1. **Read Repair**: Updates stale data during reads.
  2. **Anti-Entropy**: Background process to synchronize data between nodes using Merkle Trees.

---

#### **3. Quorums**
- **Definition**: A quorum is a set of nodes that must agree on a read or write operation to ensure consistency.
- **Key Variables**:
  - **n**: Total number of nodes in the cluster.
  - **W**: Number of nodes that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful.
  - **R**: Number of nodes that must be read from to ensure the latest value is retrieved.
- **Quorum Condition**: For a quorum to work, **W + R > n**. This ensures that at least one node overlaps between the write and read sets, guaranteeing the latest value is read.

---

#### **4. How Quorums Work**
- **Write Process**:
  - A client writes to **W** nodes and waits for acknowledgments.
  - Example: If **n = 5**, **W = 3**, the client writes to 3 nodes and waits for 3 confirmations.
- **Read Process**:
  - A client reads from **R** nodes and selects the latest value based on version numbers.
  - Example: If **R = 3**, the client reads from 3 nodes and ensures at least one node has the latest write.

#### **5. Quorums and Strong Consistency**
- **Expectation**: Quorums seem to provide strong consistency (every read returns the latest write).
- **Reality**: Quorums do **not** guarantee strong consistency due to edge cases:
  1. **Race Conditions**:
     - Example: Multiple writers send conflicting writes to different nodes in different orders.
     - Result: Nodes may disagree on the latest version, leading to inconsistent reads.
  2. **Failed Writes**:
     - Example: A write succeeds on some nodes but fails on others.
     - Result: Some readers may see the new value, while others see the old value.
  3. **Sloppy Quorums**:
     - Example: Writes are routed to a different cluster due to node failures.
     - Result: Readers in the original cluster may not see the latest writes until a **hinted handoff** transfers data back.

---

#### **6. Sloppy Quorums and Hinted Handoffs**
- **Sloppy Quorums**:
  - **Definition**: When writes are temporarily routed to a different cluster due to node failures.
  - **Issue**: Readers in the original cluster may not see the latest writes.
- **Hinted Handoff**:
  - **Definition**: A process where data written to a backup cluster is transferred back to the original cluster once it recovers.
  - **Purpose**: Ensures data consistency across clusters after failures.

---

#### **7. Limitations of Quorums**
- **No Strong Consistency**: Quorums cannot guarantee that all readers will see the latest write due to race conditions, failed writes, and sloppy quorums.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Good For**: Applications where occasional inconsistencies are acceptable (e.g., social media apps).
  - **Not Good For**: Applications requiring strict consistency (e.g., financial systems).

---

#### **8. Key Takeaways**
- **Quorums**:
  - Provide a way to ensure that reads and writes overlap in a leaderless system.
  - Require **W + R > n** to guarantee at least one overlapping node.
- **Limitations**:
  - Do **not** guarantee strong consistency due to race conditions, failed writes, and sloppy quorums.
- **Sloppy Quorums**:
  - Allow writes to be routed to backup clusters during failures.
  - Require **hinted handoffs** to restore consistency.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**
- Quorums are useful for improving consistency in leaderless systems but fall short of providing strong consistency.
- For applications requiring strict consistency, **distributed consensus** (e.g., Paxos, Raft) is necessary.
- In the next video, we’ll explore distributed consensus and how it ensures strong consistency in distributed systems.
