#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Coordination Services in Distributed Systems.
- **Goal**: Understand how coordination services ensure correct configuration management in distributed systems and how they achieve linearizable reads.

---

#### **2. What are Coordination Services?**
- **Definition**: Thin layers built on top of distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft, Zab) to manage configuration in distributed systems.
- **Purpose**: Ensure that critical configuration data (e.g., IP addresses, replication schemas, partitioning) is consistent and fault-tolerant.
- **Examples**:
  - **Zookeeper**: Uses the Zab protocol.
  - **etcd**: Built on Raft.

---

#### **3. Why Coordination Services?**
- **Critical Configuration**:
  - IP addresses for servers, databases, load balancers, CDNs.
  - Replication schemas (which database sends writes to which).
  - Partitioning breakdown (which keys are stored on which nodes).
- **Importance**:
  - Incorrect configuration can lead to serious issues (e.g., data loss, service outages).
  - Coordination services ensure that configuration data is consistent and reliable.

---

#### **4. How Coordination Services Work**
- **Consensus Algorithms**:
  - Use distributed consensus (e.g., Raft) to ensure that all nodes agree on the configuration.
  - Writes go through the leader and are replicated to followers.
- **Linearizable Reads**:
  - Ensures that reads reflect the most recent write.
  - Prevents stale or inconsistent reads.

#### **5. Ensuring Linearizable Reads**
1. **Read from the Leader**:
   - Always read from the leader to ensure the most up-to-date data.
   - **Limitation**: Creates a bottleneck, as all reads and writes go through the leader.
2. **Read from Followers with Sync**:
   - Use a **sync** operation to ensure that followers are up-to-date before reading from them.
   - **How It Works**:
     - The client writes a **sync** operation to the log.
     - The **sync** operation is propagated to all followers.
     - The client waits until the follower has processed the **sync** operation before reading.
   - **Advantage**: Reduces the load on the leader by allowing reads from followers.

#### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Coordination Services**:
  - Manage critical configuration data in distributed systems.
  - Built on distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft, Zab).
- **Linearizable Reads**:
  - Ensures that reads reflect the most recent write.
  - Achieved by reading from the leader or using **sync** operations with followers.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Coordination services are slow but necessary for correct configuration management.
  - Application data is typically stored in more scalable databases, while coordination services handle configuration.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- Coordination services are essential for managing configuration in distributed systems, ensuring consistency and fault tolerance.
- While they are not suitable for high-throughput application data, they provide the reliability needed for critical configuration.
- In the next video, weâ€™ll explore how different database technologies leverage coordination services and consensus algorithms.
