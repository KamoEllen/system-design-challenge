#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Completing the Raft Algorithm (Log Replication and Fault Tolerance).
- **Goal**: Understand how Raft ensures linearizable storage through log replication and fault tolerance.

---

#### **2. Recap of Raft**
- **Leader Role**: The leader is responsible for replicating the log to followers.
- **Followers**: May have stale logs, but the leader ensures they are brought up-to-date.
- **Key Invariant**: If two logs agree at a given index and term, they must be identical before that index.

#### **3. Log Replication in Raft**
- **Prefix and Suffix**:
  - **Prefix**: The part of the log that is consistent across the leader and follower.
  - **Suffix**: The part of the log that differs and needs to be replicated.
- **How It Works**:
  1. The leader proposes a write (e.g., "C21" at index 2).
  2. If a follower’s log doesn’t match the leader’s at the proposed index, the leader backtracks and sends the prefix (e.g., "B20" at index 1).
  3. Once the follower agrees on the prefix, the leader sends the suffix (e.g., "C21" and "D22").
  4. The follower updates its log and responds with "yes."
- **Commitment**:
  - The leader commits the write once it receives "yes" from a majority (quorum) of nodes.
  - The leader then informs all followers to commit the write.

#### **4. Why Raft Works**
1. **Single Leader per Term**:
   - Ensures only one leader can propose writes in a given term.
   - Prevents conflicting writes from multiple leaders.
2. **Quorum Requirement**:
   - A majority of nodes must agree on a write for it to be committed.
   - Ensures that committed writes survive leader failures.
3. **Log Consistency**:
   - The leader’s log is always at least as up-to-date as a majority of nodes.
   - Ensures that stale nodes can be brought up-to-date.

---

#### **5. Key Takeaways**
- **Raft Log Replication**:
  - Ensures that all nodes agree on the order of writes.
  - Uses prefixes and suffixes to efficiently replicate logs.
- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Committed writes are guaranteed to survive leader failures.
  - Stale nodes are brought up-to-date by the leader.
- **Linearizability**:
  - Ensures that reads reflect the most recent write.

---

#### **6. Limitations of Raft**
1. **Performance**:
   - All writes and reads must go through the leader, creating a bottleneck.
   - Not suitable for high-throughput applications.
2. **Two-Phase Commit**:
   - Raft does not replace two-phase commit for cross-partition transactions.
   - Two-phase commit is still needed for heterogeneous writes across different partitions.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- Raft provides fault-tolerant, linearizable storage by ensuring that all nodes agree on the order of writes.
- While Raft is powerful for specific use cases (e.g., distributed locks), it is not a general-purpose solution for high-throughput systems.
- In the next video, we’ll explore how Raft can be used to build distributed locks and other applications.
