#### **1. Introduction**
- **Topic**: Linearizable Storage in Distributed Systems.
- **Goal**: Understand what linearizable storage is, why it’s important, and how it ensures correct reads and writes in distributed systems.

---

#### **2. What is Linearizable Storage?**
- **Definition**: A storage system where all operations (reads and writes) appear to occur in a single, globally consistent order.
- **Key Property**: Reads never go "back in time." If a read observes a write, all subsequent reads must reflect that write or a later one.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Distributed Locks**: Ensure only one client holds a lock at a time.
  - **Database Leadership**: Ensure only one leader exists, even during failures.

---

#### **3. Why Linearizability Matters**
- **Correct Reads**: Ensures that reads reflect the most recent write, preventing inconsistencies.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintains correctness even when nodes fail or partitions occur.
- **Example**:
  - Write 1: "Node A is leader."
  - Write 2: "Node B is leader."
  - A read after Write 2 must never return "Node A is leader."

#### **4. Ordering Writes in Distributed Systems**
1. **Single-Leader Replication**:
   - **Replication Log**: Writes are ordered by the leader and propagated to followers.
   - **Limitation**: If the leader fails before propagating a write, followers may not have the latest data, breaking linearizability.
2. **Multi-Leader and Leaderless Replication**:
   - **Challenge**: Concurrent writes can occur on different nodes, making global ordering difficult.
   - **Solution**: Use **version vectors** or **Lamport clocks** to establish a partial order of writes.

---

#### **5. Version Vectors and Lamport Clocks**
- **Version Vectors**:
  - Track the number of writes seen from each node.
  - Example: `[3, 1]` means 3 writes from Node A and 1 write from Node B.
  - **Limitation**: Requires O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes.
- **Lamport Clocks**:
  - Use a single counter per node to order events.
  - **How It Works**:
    - Each node maintains a local counter.
    - On a write, the counter is incremented and propagated.
    - If a node receives a write with a higher counter, it updates its counter to the maximum value + 1.
  - **Advantage**: Uses constant space (O(1)).

---

#### **6. Limitations of Lamport Clocks**
- **Partial Order**: Lamport clocks provide a total order for writes, but they don’t guarantee linearizability.
- **Example**:
  - Write 1: "X = 1" (Node A, Lamport timestamp 1).
  - Write 2: "X = 5" (Node B, Lamport timestamp 2).
  - A client reads "X = 1" from Node A, then "X = 5" from Node B, and finally "X = 1" from Node A again.
  - This violates linearizability because the read order doesn’t match the write order.

---

#### **7. Single-Leader Replication and Linearizability**
- **Replication Log**: Ensures writes are ordered on the leader and propagated to followers.
- **Limitation**:
  - If the leader fails before propagating a write, followers may not have the latest data.
  - Example:
    - Write 1: "X = 5" (leader).
    - Write 2: "X = 10" (leader).
    - If the leader fails after Write 1 but before propagating Write 2, a follower may return "X = 5" even after the leader has written "X = 10."

---

#### **8. Total Order Broadcast**
- **Definition**: A protocol that ensures all nodes agree on the order of writes.
- **Key Property**: Guarantees linearizability by ensuring all nodes see writes in the same order.
- **Use Case**: Essential for implementing linearizable storage in distributed systems.

---

#### **9. Key Takeaways**
- **Linearizable Storage**:
  - Ensures reads reflect the most recent write.
  - Prevents "going back in time" scenarios.
- **Ordering Mechanisms**:
  - **Single-Leader Replication**: Uses a replication log but is not fault-tolerant.
  - **Multi-Leader/Leaderless Replication**: Uses version vectors or Lamport clocks but doesn’t guarantee linearizability.
- **Total Order Broadcast**: Required for true linearizability in distributed systems.

---

#### **10. Conclusion**
- Linearizable storage is critical for ensuring correctness in distributed systems, especially for use cases like distributed locks and database leadership.
- While mechanisms like replication logs, version vectors, and Lamport clocks help order writes, they don’t fully guarantee linearizability.
- In the next video, we’ll explore **distributed consensus** protocols (e.g., Paxos, Raft) that enable total order broadcast and linearizable storage.
