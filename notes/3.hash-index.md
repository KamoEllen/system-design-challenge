#### **1. Recap of Previous Lecture**
- **Problem**: Without indexes, database operations (reads and writes) have **O(n)** time complexity, which is inefficient for large datasets.
- **Solution**: Use **indexes** to speed up data retrieval.
- **Trade-Off**: Indexes improve read speeds but may slow down writes.

---

#### **2. Introduction to Hash Indexes**
- **What is a Hash Index?**:
  - A type of database index based on a **hashmap** data structure.
  - Maps keys (e.g., names) to values (e.g., disk locations or rows).
  - Provides **O(1)** time complexity for both reads and writes.

---

#### **3. How Hashmaps Work**
- **Hash Function**:
  - A function that takes a key (e.g., "Jordan") and returns a fixed-size number (e.g., 4).
  - Ensures that the same key always produces the same hash value.
  - Example:
    - `hash("Jordan") = 4`
    - `hash("Shaq") = 4` (collision example).
- **Hashmap Structure**:
  - An array where each index corresponds to a hash value.
  - Keys are stored at their respective hash indices.
  - Example:
    ```
    Array Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    Value:      - - - - Jordan - - - - -
    ```

---

#### **4. Handling Collisions**
- **Collision**: When two keys hash to the same index (e.g., "Jordan" and "Shaq" both hash to 4).
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Chaining**:
     - Store multiple keys at the same index using a linked list.
     - Example:
       ```
       Index 4: Jordan → Shaq
       ```
  2. **Probing**:
     - Place the second key in the next available index.
     - Example:
       ```
       Index 4: Jordan
       Index 5: Shaq
       ```
- **Time Complexity**: On average, hashmap operations remain **O(1)** despite collisions.

---

#### **5. Hash Indexes in Databases**
- **How It Works**:
  - The hash index maps keys (e.g., names) to disk locations or rows.
  - Example:
    ```
    Key: "Jordan" → Disk Location: 0x1234
    Key: "Shaq" → Disk Location: 0x5678
    ```
- **Benefits**:
  - **O(1)** reads and writes for key-based queries.
  - Extremely fast for retrieving specific rows.

---

#### **6. Challenges with Hash Indexes**
1. **Disk Performance**:
   - Hashmaps are **inefficient on disk** because they require random access.
   - Disk reads/writes are slower than memory, and hashmap operations involve jumping around the disk.
   - Solution: Keep the hash index **in memory (RAM)** for faster access.

2. **Memory Constraints**:
   - RAM is expensive and limited in size.
   - All keys must fit in memory, which may not be feasible for large datasets.

3. **Durability**:
   - RAM is volatile; data is lost if the system shuts down.
   - Solution: Use a **write-ahead log (WAL)** to ensure durability.

---

#### **7. Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**
- **What is a WAL?**:
  - A log file stored on disk that records all changes (writes) to the database.
  - Example:
    ```
    Change size of row with "Jordan" to 10.
    Change size of row with "Shaq" to 26.
    ```
- **How It Works**:
  - Before updating the hash index in memory, write the change to the WAL on disk.
  - If the system crashes, the WAL can be replayed to rebuild the hash index.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides **durability** (data is not lost on system failure).
  - Sequential disk writes are faster than random writes.

---

#### **8. Limitations of Hash Indexes**
- **No Support for Range Queries**:
  - Hash indexes are optimized for **key-based queries** (e.g., find rows where name = "Jordan").
  - They cannot efficiently handle **range queries** (e.g., find rows where name is between "A" and "B").
  - Reason: Hashmaps distribute keys randomly, making it impossible to iterate through a range of keys efficiently.
  - Example:
    - To find all names between "A" and "B," you would need to check every possible key, which is **O(n)**.

---

#### **9. Alternatives for Range Queries**
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**:
  - Support range queries efficiently.
  - Time complexity: **O(log n)** for reads and writes.
  - Trade-Off: Slower than hash indexes (O(1)) for key-based queries.

---

#### **10. When to Use Hash Indexes**
- **Use Cases**:
  - When you need **O(1)** reads and writes for key-based queries.
  - When your dataset is small enough to fit in memory.
  - When you don’t need to support range queries.
- **Example**: A database that only retrieves specific rows by ID or name.

---

#### **11. Key Takeaways**
- **Hash Indexes**:
  - Provide **O(1)** reads and writes for key-based queries.
  - Must be kept in memory for performance.
  - Use a **write-ahead log (WAL)** for durability.
- **Limitations**:
  - Inefficient for **range queries**.
  - Limited by memory size.
- **Trade-Offs**:
  - Fast for key-based queries but unsuitable for range queries.
  - Requires additional mechanisms (e.g., WAL) for durability.
